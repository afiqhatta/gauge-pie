<h2> Deriving the Pauli equation from the Dirac equation</h2> 
<p> 
Before quantum field theory, the Pauli equation 
could describe the evolution of electrons and other spin 1/2 particles.
Particles with spin can be described as states with two components, 
which are called 'doublets'. 
These two component states can be written mathematically as 
\[ \psi  = \begin{pmatrix} \psi _ + \\ \psi _ + \end{pmatrix} \] 
where the evolution of each component can be solved 
by the Pauli equation 

\[ i \hbar \frac{ \partial \psi } { \partial t }  = \left[ e \phi + \frac { 1 } { 2 m } 
\left( ( \mathbf { p } + e \mathbf { A } ) \cdot \sigma  \right) ^ 2 \right] \psi \] 

</p>

<p> 
This is a matrix differential equation, so 
we have to solve for both components. 
In non-relativistic quantum mechanics, 
the Pauli equation dictates the state of a particle with spin, 
for example an electron, which can interact with a background magnetic field. 
The Pauli equation gives rise to a natural constant, 
the g-factor, which is a coefficient of one of the terms 
in the equation. It implies that this g-factor is 2. 
However, quantum field theory implies that there are 
corrections to this term, and this has been discovered experimentally. 
In fact, it is one of the most rigorously measured 
quantities in modern physics. 
</p> 

<p> 
In quantum field theory, Dirac recovered a more 
complete equation which one can solve, to get information 
about the evolution of spin 1/2 particles. 
Firstly, instead of 2 component doublets, the particles 
are now represented with 4 component <i> spinors</i>, 
which are a slightly different type of object. 
I will not go into details, but they are objects 
motivated by valid 'representations' of the Lorentz group, 
and one can write down equations to solve for for these objects as well. 
</p> 

<p> 
Coupled to the electromagnetic field, 
we find that just simply rearranging the Dirac equation by 
shoving the terms to the opposite side, and multiplying by \( \gamma ^ 0 \), 
gives us an equation which is <b>already</b> reminiscent of 
a Schrodinger type equation 
\[ i \partial t \psi  = \left[ \gamma ^ 0 ( m + e \gamma \cdot \mathbf A  - i \gamma \cdot \nabla ) + e \phi \right] \psi \] 
</p> 

<p>
If we write this out explicitly in terms of the Pauli matrices, 
we recover that the operator acting on \( \psi \), 
which we will identify as the 'Hamiltonian', can be written 
in terms of the momentum \( \mathbf p = - i h \nabla \) as 

\[ H = \begin{pmatrix} 
m + e \phi & \sigma \cdot ( \mathbf p + e \mathbf  { A } ) \\ 
 - \sigma \cdot ( \mathbf p + e \mathbf A ) &  - m + e \phi \end{pmatrix} \]
We employ a trick to 'reduce' this problem into a form 
which only acts on the 2-component spinors. We do this by 
squaring the Hamiltonian and preserving the leading order terms. 
We find that the first element on the diagonal 
of this matrix gives, after square rooting it

\[ H = m c ^ 2 + e \phi + \frac{ 1 } { 2 m } ( \sigma \cdot ( \mathbf p + e \mathbf A ) ) ^ 2 \]
</p> 
<p> 
If we want to compare this to the non-relativistic Pauli equation, 
we remove that rest mass. We also can 
work in the gauge where \( \mathbf A = \frac{ 1 } { 2 } ( \mathbf B \times \mathbf r ) \). 
Mutliplying everything out to first order yields that 
the non-relativistic Hamiltoinian
gives 
(note: one should also try this out with different Gamma matrix representations, such as the Weyl representation - I can't seem to recover the correct result though)

\[ H = e \phi + \frac{1} { 2 m } ( | \mathbf { p } | ^ 2  - e \mathbf B \cdot ( \mathbf p \times \mathbf r )  - q \sigma \cdot \mathbf B ) \] 
</p>

If we, without loss of generality, 
set the magnetic field in the direction z, we find that 
the terms which are coupled to 
the magnetic field in the above equation can be written in the 
form 
\[ H_{\text{coupling} }  = e B _z ( L _ z + g S_ z ) \] 
\( g\) is our gyromagnetic factor, which 
represents the ratio of our spin coupling to 
our angular momentum coupling. 
<h2>An alternative approach: Getting the Pauli equation from the Dirac equation</h2> 
<p> 
The equation itself is

\[ \left[ \gamma ^ \mu \left( i \partial _ \mu  - e A _ \mu \right) - m \right] \psi  = 0 \] 
This equation is invariant to a change of basis in terms 
of Lorentz invariance. In the equation, \( A_ \mu \) represents 
the potential associated with our magentic field. 
The gamma term represents the Gamma matrices, which obey the Clifford algebra. 
</p> 

<p> 
To solve this equation in terms of a 
given energy, we need to convert this into an eigenvalue-like problem 
by plugging in an ansatz for the wavefunction. 
The differential equation is separable, so we decompose the spinors 
into stationary solutions - and write the spinor in momentum space.  

\[ \psi ( x ^ \mu) = u ( p ) e ^ { i p \cdot x } \]  
</p> 

<p> 
Substituting this in gives us 
the equation to solve 
\[ \begin{pmatrix} 
i \partial _ t  - e \phi & i \sigma \cdot \nabla  - e \sigma \cdot \mathbf { A } \\
 - i \sigma \cdot \nabla  -  + e \sigma \cdot \mathbf { A } &  - i \partial _ t + e \phi 
\end{pmatrix} 
\begin{pmatrix} u _ + ( p ) e ^ { - i E p \cdot x }  \\ u _ - ( p ) e ^ { - i E p \cdot x } \end{pmatrix}  = 0  
\]
In the non-relativistic limit, we
can make some simplifying assumptions. 
When the field is weak, our energy is roughly equivalent to the 
rest mass of the electron. Our momentum is also roughly equal to the 
classical momentum. 
\[ E  + e \phi \approx m c^ 2, \quad \mathbf{ p } = m \mathbf { v } \] 

The system of equations which are obtained, without 
the relativistic approximation, is 
\[ 
\begin{aligned} 
 ( E  - e \phi ) u _ +  - c \sigma \cdot ( \mathbf p - e \mathbf A ) u _ -  &  = m c ^ 2 u _ + \\ 
\end{aligned} 
\] 

The expression \( E - mc^ 2 \) is the energy that we would get from
the classical energy of an electrically charged particle in a field. 
In the relativistic paradigm, we have that 

\[  E  = \frac{ m c^ 2 } { \sqrt { 1 - \frac{ v ^ 2 } { c ^ 2 } } + e \phi \] 
This is the sum of our relativistic kinetic energy, as well as 
the electromagnetic potential energy. To solve the above system, 
we first write out \( u _ - \) as a function of \( u _ + \). 
We should find that we get the term \( m c ^ 2 + E - e \phi \approx 2 m c ^ 2 \)
to the first approximation where the field is weak. 
This gives 
\[ ( E - m c ^ 2 ) u _ +  - \frac{ | \sigma \cdot ( \mathbf { p }  - e \mathbf { A } ) | ^ 2 } { 2 m } u _ +   = e \phi u_ + \]  
We recognise the righthand most term as the non-relativistic energy to the first approximation. 
This leads us to the Pauli equation.
</p> 

<h2>What does the Pauli equation imply about the g-factor?</h2>
Originally, the g factor is a ratio which is not set to two. 
The Dirac equation implied that it was two after some approximations. 
The Dirac equation can be written as, without coupling to an electromagnetic field,  
\[ H  = \gamma ^ 0 ( m - i \gamma \cdot \nabla ) \]
