<p>Lots of news websites only criticize, but don’t offer solutions. This is a bit confusing to me. News websites are privy to lots of information that could help with the problems that they report. However, they don’t offer recommendations. This is suboptimal - they have large audiences to act on the recommendations that they publish</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Most people read news, but then don’t act on possibly privileged information that they have. However, some newspapers like the New York Times have indeed done this. </p>
<p>Should newspapers be more active in designing technology and solutions for problems? </p>
<p>In addition, should there be more active work in trying to increase the level of interactivity in news? For example, <a href="http://distill.pub">distill.pub</a> has a great article on interactivity in scientific articles. <a href="https://distill.pub/2020/communicating-with-interactive-articles/">https://distill.pub/2020/communicating-with-interactive-articles/</a></p>
