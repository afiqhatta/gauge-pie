Corrections to the magnetic moment

<h2> Why does the covariant derivative look the way it does? </h2> 
<p> 
In quantum electrodynamics, the Dirac equation 
coupled with an electromagnetic vector potential looks like 
\[ D _ \mu = \partial _ \mu + i e A_ \mu \] 
Why does the coefficient in front of the vector 
potential need to be imaginary? Why can't we have a covariant derivative 
that looks like 

\[ D_\mu = \partial _ \mu + e A _\mu \] 
</p> 

<p>
Well, we need to make sure that 
the equation still satisfies given a gauge transform. 
The gauge transform has a U(1) structure, which means 
that the spinor transformation has to be compatible with this.  
\[\begin{aligned} 
A _ \mu & \to A _ \mu + \partial _ \mu \chi \\
\psi & \to \psi e ^{  - i e \chi }  
\end{aligned} \]  
</p> 

<p> 
The only way for this to hold means 
in the covariant derivative, we need a \( i \) 
attached to the vector term. 
</p> 

<h2> What needs a correction? </h2>  
<p> 
Given the current Dirac equation for a spinor, 
we can write it in a form similar to the Klein-Gordon equation 
by multiplying it by the conjugate, and we will find that 
we will get an extra correction to the typical Klein-Gordon equation.  
</p> 

<p>
This can be shown by some clever use of identities. 
We can multiply the Dirac spinor equation through as follows  
\[ \begin{aligned} 
 0 &= \left[ ( i \partial _\mu - e A _ \mu )( i \partial _ \nu - e A _ \nu ) \gamma ^ \mu \gamma ^ \mu - m ^ 2 \right] \psi \\
  &= \left( \frac{ 1 } { 4} \{ i D _ \mu , iD _ \nu \} \{ \gamma^ \mu , \gamma ^ \nu \} + \frac{1 } { 4} [ i D _ \mu , i D _ \nu ] [ \gamma^ \mu , 
\gamma^ \nu ]  - m ^ 2 \right) \psi 
	\end{aligned}
\] 

This simplifies to a correction to what would 
be a Klein-Gordon equation. This is 
\[ 
\left( (i D _ \mu )^ 2  - \frac{ e} { 2 } F _ \mu \nu \sigma ^ { \mu \nu }  - m ^ 2 \right) \psi  = 0 \] 
We can interpret this as a difference in the covariant derivatives on spinors vs scalars.   
The F sigma term gives us the magnetic moment, so we need to look at corrections of this form. 

</p>

<h2> What is the correction at tree level</h2> 
<p> 
A useful way to think about corrections 
is looking at the process of a spinor interacting with an electron, 
and decaying into another spinor. We examine processes of 
the form 
\[ e ^  - (p ) A_ \mu( p )  \to e ^ - ( q _ 2) \] 
The tree level amplitude is given by the diagram with a 
single photon ray interacting with a spinor. 
The amplitude from this is given by 
the vertex rule 

\[ M _ 0^ \mu  = - i e \bar{ u } ( q_ 2) \gamma ^ \mu u ( q _ 1 ) \]
With the Gordon identity, we can back out a term 
with \( \sigma ^ { \mu \nu } \), whose coefficients 
we can identify with the magnetic moment. 
The Gordon identity implies that the amplitude can be written as 

\[ M _ 0 ^ \mu  =  - e \frac{  q _1 ^ \mu + q _ 2 ^ \mu } { 2 m } \bar { u }( q _ 2 ) u ( q _ 1 )  - \frac{ e } { 2 m } i \bar { u } ( q _ 2 ) p _ \nu \sigma ^ { \mu \nu } u ( q _ 1 ) \]

</p>
<p> 
In general, 
the correction to the magnetic moment is given 
by the sum of all graphs which involve a photon interacting with an electron.
In general, this is given by some coefficients in front of each momentum vector. 
At first glance, the scattering amplitude should look like 
\[ i M ^ \mu = \bar { u } ( q _ 2) ( f_ 1 \gamma ^ \mu + f _ 2 p _ 2 ^ \mu + f _3 q _ 1 ^ \mu + f_ 4 q _ 2 ^ \mu ) u ( q _ 1 )\] 
</p> 
<p>
Note that due to momentum conservation, we have that we can take out any dependence on \( p ^ \mu). 
In addition, the Dirac equation tells us that we can write, in momentum space to first order that 
\[ \gamma ^ \mu q _ { i \mu } u ( q _ i )  = m u ( q _ i ). \] This, in combination with 
the Gordon identity allows us to write the most general form 
of the scattering amplitude for this type of interaction: 

\[ i M ^ \mu = ( - ie ) \bar { u }  ( q _ 2 ) \left[ F _1 ( \frac{ p ^ 2 } { m ^ 2 } ) + \frac{ i \sigma ^ { \mu \nu} }{ 2 m } p _ \nu F _ 2 ( \frac{ p ^ 2 } { m ^ 2 } ) \right] u ( q _ 1  ) \] 
  
We simplify this considerably using a combination of 
the Ward identity.
