Fibres and Fibrations

<p> 
In general relativity, we work with vector spaces attached to 
points on manifolds. Recall that a manifold 
is a space where for each point, there is a neighbourhood which can 
be mapped smoothly to a subset of \( \mathbb{ R } ^ n \).

In undergraduate general relativity, 
these kinds of spaces are only considered locally 
around a point on this manifold. However, it is useful to 
consider how the vector spaces 'roll' across the manifold.
In other words, we want to formalise the entire space of tangent spaces 
attached to each point of the manifolds. For this purpose, 
we need to use some math in the fields of geometry and topology.   
This article will flesh out what a fibre bundle and a fbration, and will give some examples. 
</p> 

<p> 
To analyse this kind of science, we use 
the idea of a fibration - which in topology is  
when we use one space as a parameter space for a bunch of other spaces. 
For example, think of a sphere and attach a tangent
plane to every single point. 
We can think of this as a space in which locally, 
every point looks like a 'product space'.  
</p>  

<h2>Some basic point-set topology</h2> 
<p>
A topological space has a pretty formal definition. 
It is a space in which the idea of 'closeness' and 'neighbourhoods'
are well defined in terms of open sets. Formally, 
a topological space is defined to be a space endowed with a set of 'open sets'. 
\( T = ( x , \tau \) \), where \(x \in X \), and \( \tau \in P ( X ) \). 

A topological space has to satisfy a few axioms. 
Firstly, the empty set and the set itself must be open sets. 
Secondly, any union of open sets must be an open set. 
Finally, an finite intersection of open sets must be an open set. 
</p> 

<p> 
To understand what a fibre bundle is, we have to understand what a 
product topology is. A product topology is 
a topological space induced when we have multiple spaces. The product topology
is the coarsest topology such that the projection function is 
a continuous function (defined in the topological sense). 
</p>

<p> 
For example, let \( X _ 1 = \mathbf{ R } \), and \( X _ 2 \) also be the real line. 
Let the topologies for both sets be the topologies induced by the standard Euclidean metric. 
We define the projections 
\[ p _ i ( x _ 1 , x_ 2 ) \mapsto x_ i \]
and it is clear to see that this projection is continuous with respect to the 
topology induced by the two dimensional Euclidean metric, and hence the product topology is 
precisely this. 
</p> 

<h2>Fibre bundles</h2> 
<p> 
A fibre bundle is a space in which we can 'push down' the space to a smaller base space. 
The inverse function of this projection must map any given neighbourhood to a product space locally. 
More formally, a fibre bundle is a set of topological spaces \( E, B , F\), paired with a continuous 
surjection \( \pi \), which satisfy some conditions. 

<ul> 
	<li> Firstly, we must have that \( \pi : E \to B \) is a continuous surjection. </li>
	<li> Secondly, given some neighbourhood in our base space, there exists some continuous, invertible map which gives 
		us a homeomorphism from the inverse of the projection to a product space \( B \times F \), of the base space and 
		fibre. In other words, given some \( b \in B \), a point in our base space, we can construct a local neighbourhood 
		\( b \in U _ b \), and we find the homeomorphism 
		\[ \pi ^ { -1 } ( U _ b ) \simeq B \times F \] </li> 
	<li> Finally, there is a compatibility condition here. The homeomorphism which takes \( \pi ^ { - 1} ( U _ b ) \) to 
		\( B \times F \) should satisfy 
		\[ \text{Proj_1} \circ \phi = \pi \] defined on \( \pi ^ { - 1} ( U _ b ) \) </li>
</ul>

The interesting part is that this is a weaker condition than 
being a product space globally. For example, there are 'non-trivial' fibre bundles 
in which the space itself can't be written as a product space globally, but locally 
we have that neighbourhoods of the base space are homeomorphic to fibre bundles. 
<h3> Trivial fibre bundles </h3> 
<p>
An example of a 
trivial fibre bundle with a base space \( S ^ 1 \) and with fibres 
\( [ 0, 1 ] \) is just a cylinder. 
We construct the product space 
\[ S ^ 1 \times [ 0 , 1 ] = \{ (x, y, z) \mid x^ 2 + y ^ 2 = 1, \quad 0 \leq z \leq 1 \}  \]
We define our projection from the total space 
to the base space as the map \( p : S ^ 1 \times I \to S ^ 1 \), 
given by mapping 
\[ ( x , y, z ) \mapsto ( x, y ) \] 
Given a small neighbourhood on this circle after the projection,
the inverse map is homeomorphic to the product space by definition. 
If we take a small segment from the circle, the 
pre-image of the map is just a slice of this circle.  
</p>
<h2>Non-trivial fibre bundle examples</h2> 
<p>
Given a pair of topological spaces, it 
is easy to construct a fibre bundle in which our global space looks like a
product. For example, if we take our manifold 
to be be a sphere \( S ^ 2 \), and another space \( \mathbb { R} \), 
we could take the product space of the two and define a projection map 
onto our base space. 
</p> 

<p> 
The first interesting example of a non-trivial fibre bundle 
is a Mobius strip. If we call the total space of the 
Mobius strip \( E \), and let the base space \(B\) be the centre circle of this space, 
then we can use the following parametrisation to show that it is indeed a fibre bundle. 
</p> 
<p> 
First, parametrise our Mobius strip with 
the coordinates
\[ x ( u, v ) = ( 1 + \frac{ v }{ 2 } \cos \frac{ u } { 2} ) \cos u, \quad y ( u , v ) = ( 1 + \frac{ v } { 2 } \cos \frac{ u } { 2 } ) \sin u , \quad z ( u , v) = \frac{ v }{ 2 } \sin \frac{ u } { 2 } \]

<h3><b>Projecting onto our base space</b></h3>
Our projection map \( \pi \) shall be the map when we set 
\[ ( x ( u, v ), y ( u, v ), z ( u , v) ) \mapsto ( x ( u , 0) , y ( u, 0 ) , z ( u , 0 )) \mapsto ( x( u , 0 ) , y ( u , 0 )) = ( \cos u, \sin u )\]  
This is continuous and surjective.
Now, for this example, let's take \( u = \delta \in ( - \delta ^ * , \delta ^ * ) \). 
where \( \delta ^ * \) is small, so that we have no problems with invertability. 
In this case, our base neighbourhood is 
\[ U _ 0 = \{ ( 1 , \delta ) | \delta \in ( - \delta^ * , \delta ^ * ) \} \] 

<h3><b>Building the inverse map into the product space</b></h3> 
The inverse space is 
\[ \pi ^ { -1 } ( U _ 0 ) = \left( \left( 1 + \frac{ v } { 2 } \cos \frac{ \delta } { 2 } \right) \cos \delta , \left( 1 + \frac{ v} { 2} \cos \frac{ \delta } { 2 } \right) \sin \delta , \frac{ v } { 2 } \sin \frac{ u } {2} \right) = \left( \left(1 + \frac{ v} { 2} \right) , \left( 1 + \frac{ v } { 2 } \right) \delta , \frac{ \delta v} { 4 } \right) \] 

We construct the map to the product space 
as follows.
We take the map 
\[ \phi : ( x , y, z ) \mapsto ( 1 , y / x, z / x ) \]
This is a homeomorphism since the map has a well defined derivative in our neighbourhood
and so an inverse exists. 
Applying this to the preimage, we have that 
\[ \phi ( \pi ^ { -1 } (U _ 0 ) ) = \{ ( 1 , \delta, \frac{ \delta v } { 4 + 2 v } ) \}  = \{ ( 1 , \delta) \}  \times \{ \frac{ \delta v } { 4 + 2 v } \}  \simeq  B \times F \] 
If we project down onto our first factor (the first two components), we get our 
original section of our base space. 
So, this is a fibration.
