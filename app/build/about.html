<p>
I'm Afiq Hatta. Currently, I am a Part III Mathematics student at Trinity Hall, 
University of Cambridge. Right now, I'm studying the problems that crop up in quantum field theory, string theory, and theoretical condensed matter, but I aspire to work in trading!
I made this website to document some mathematics and physics that I've found interesting.  
</p> 

<p> 
I find explaining things a great way to learn. 
</p>

<p>
As an undergraduate at Cambridge, I've had the opportunity to intern in 
<ul> 
	<li>London at Goldman Sachs</li>
	<li>Oxford at Oxford Asset Management </li> 
	<li>Kuala Lumpur for the Malaysian Central Bank</li>
</ul> 
These internships have been thoroughly mathematical, and have been within in a quantitative research capacity. 
Roughly, they have involved on scientific computing, optimisation, and natural language processing.
