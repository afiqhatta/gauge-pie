<h2> Moving from the classical path to the quantum path </h2> 
	<p>
		In classical mechanics, we are given a Lagrangian 
		\( L = T - V\), where \( T \) is our kinetic energy and \( V \) 
		is our potential energy. In this scenario, we can 
		associate an action to this Lagrangian, and solving for the path 
		which extremises this action is the path that the particle classically takes. 
	</p>
	<p>
		As we know from classical mechanics, the action associated with 
		a Lagrangian classically is given by the integral of the Lagrangian 
		with respect to time, where the start point and end point \( x _ A \) 
		and \( x _ B \) are fixed at \( t _ A , t_B \) respectively. 	
		\[  S = \int _ {t_ A} ^ { t _ B } dt  \, \, L ( x, \dot{ x } , t ) \quad , \text{ with solution given by } \frac{ \delta S } { \delta x }  =0 \] 
		Once we solve this equation, we can then proceed to calculate the actual 
		action. 
	</p> 

	<p>
		In the quantum sense, we can 
		write out the propagator between two states, as the probability amplitude 
		that one state will evolve into another. 
		By repeated use of the completion identity, we come to 
		the conclusion that the propagator 
		is proportional to the path integral 
		\[ \langle x_ b \mid e ^ {  -i H t } \mid \rangle \]
	</p> 
	<p> 
		Using the completion identity, the resulting 
		path integral looks 
		like a sum expression where the associated probability with a given 
		path \( x ( t ) \) has the phase \( e ^ { i S } \) associated with it. 
		Now, when we integrate over mamy different paths to get the propagator which 
		looks like 
		\[ i G( x_a, t_a, x _b, t_b )  = \int \mathbf{ D } x \, \,  e ^ {\int _ {t_ A } ^ {t_ B } dt \,  L ( x , t ) } \] 
		Now, on average, we expect that most of these different 
		paths with probability \( e ^ { iS } \) will cancel out due to different phase factors. 
	</p>

<h2> Why is it the case that the classical actions still dominate?</h2>  
	<p> 
		In general, we should not expect that a quantum correction to 
		something classical should be that big. After all, to first order, 
		Newton's classical laws of motion work for us - so why is there not a big change? 
		Well, this is due to the fact many of the 
		paths cancel out, as we shall see. 
	<p> 
		However, near a classical path, many of these phase factors 
		look the same and therefore we find constructive interference to make 
		the classical path the dominating term in the integral. 
		To see this, we will show that paths near the path integral all have a 
		similar phase, and therefore constructively interfere with one another. 
		I realise this is a bit of a wishy washy argument but its a start. 
		If we have a stationary path, then we can expand the action in terms 
		of a Taylor expansion with functional derivatives.  
		\[ S [ x_ c ( t ) + \delta x ( t ) ] = S [ x _ c ( t ) ] +  C \cdot \frac{ S } { \delta x } + O ( \delta x ^ 2 ) \] 
	</p>
	<p> 
		More formally, this expansion is given by
		the series of integrals 
		\[ S [ x_ c ( t ) + \delta x ( t )  = S [ x _ c ( t ) ] + \int dt  \, \frac{ \delta S } { \delta x } \mid _ { x  = x _ c }  ( t ) \mid \delta x ( t )  \]  
		This is to first order. Functional derivatives are in 
		general given by the expression 
		\[ \delta S [ f ]  = \int _ { t _A  } ^ { t _ B }  dt \, \frac { \delta S } { \delta f } \delta f  \]
		Supposing that \( S \) is a function of \( f \) and its first derivative, 
		we then have that \( \frac{ \delta S }{ \delta f}  = \frac{ \partial L } { \partial f }  - \frac{ d } { dt } \frac{ \partial L} { \partial \dot { f } } \) 
		Since the classical path solves this by definition, we have that the 
		perturbation is given by 
		\[ S [ x _ c (t ) + \delta x ( t) \] = S [ x_c ( t ) ] + O ( \delta x ^ 2 ) \] 
	</p>  
	<p> 
	
	<p> 
		Armed with this knowledge, 
		we can then calculate the form of a path integral to first order 
		for some basic systems. We know that the 
		path which extremises the action \( S \) is only, in the classical picture, 
		a function of the start and end points \( x _A \) and \( x _ B \). With the argument above that most 
		of the paths cancel each other out, we can heuristically write that 
		\[  i G ( x _ a , x _ b, t _ b, t _ a ) = \int \mathbf { D } x \, e^ { i S [ x] } = 
			\int \mathbf{D } x \, e ^ { i S [ x _c + \delta x ] } \]
		Because of the expansion, we can make use of the expansion above and 
		observe that \( x _ c \) by construction is only a function of \( x _a, x_ b ,t \), 
		so we can factor it out. So, we have that the first 
		order correction factors out and we are left with the 
		expression
