<h2>What does the Whitney sum bundle of a Mobius strip look like?</h2>
<p> 
A Mobius trip cannot be parametrised globally 
by a set of coordinates on the product 
\( ( s, t ) \) since it is not a trivial bundle. 
However, we find that the Whitney sum of 
two Mobius bands is a trivial bundle. 
</p> 

<p> 
The transition function associated with the 
Whitney sum of a Mobius trip in the 
top hemisphere of the circle is \( I \), 
and is \( - I \) in the bottom hemisphere. 
We need to show a change of coordinates which will trivialise 
this function everywhere. 
Just multiply by diag(1, -1), and diag(-1, 1), by 
setting a new coordinate local trivialisations 
to be defined as \( \tilde{ \phi \} _ 1 ( p )  = (t, -t) \) on the upper hemisphere, 
and the corresponding reverse map on the lower hemiphere. 
This gives \( g1 = diag(1, -1) \) , and the corresponding \( g_ 2 \) 
element. This change of coordinates allows us to transform 
our transition functions,  
and this should make the transition functions trivial everywhere. 

We cannot do this in the single dimensional case, 
since one of the charts will have to be taken to be the 
identity, which is a contradiction. 
<p> 
To construct the Whitney sum, we will show that 
the transition functions anywhere on the 
manifold can be taken to be trivial. 
Given some fibre bundle \( E \to B \), if there 
is a point in the intersection of two 
open covers \( p \in U _ i \cap U _ j \), then
there exists two diffeomorphisms which 
between this and the fibre space. 
In other words, we have that 
\[ \phi _ i : U _ i \times F \to \pi ^ { - 1} ( U _ i ) \]  
</p>
<p> 
The transition function defined at the point \(p\) 
in the manifold is the function which 
maps the fibres associated with the diffeomorphisms 
to one another. For a bundle to be trival, we 
must be able to take these as the identity everywhere. 
</p> 

\[ t _ ij ( x) : F \to F \] 
<p> 
For a Mobius band, the two transition functions 
on the disjoint open sets are the identity and the sign flip 
functions respectively. 
For the Whitney sum, it is \( I , -I \). 
</p> 

<p> 
The 1 dimensional case is not trivial 
because there does not exist a way 
to make the transition function the identity by construction. 
To see this, it suffices to observe that t_12 is not the identity 
by construction. 
However, on the product bundle, we can convert -I to I 
by 
<p>
If we have two vector bundles on a given space,
we can construct a <b>Whitney sum bundle</b>, which 
is a space where at every point, the fibres look like 
a direct product of two vector spaces.  
</p> 

<p> 
The simplest way to visualise a direct product is 
taking \( \mathbb{ R } \) as an example - the 
direct sum of the real line with itself is \( mathbb { R }^ 2 \). 
The Whitney sum bundle of a manifold 
is the construct that we get when we combinine two vector bundles 
such that at every point, the fibre is the direct sum 
\( V \oplus W\) of the two vector spaces.  
</p>

<p> 
Moreover, this fibration should 
preserve the properties of the original 
manifold. This means that, when we projecto down, we should still get the base space. 

<h3>Constructing the Whitney Sum</h3>
<p>
A Mobius strip is constructed by making a unit interval \( I \) as the 
fibre over the circle \( S ^ 1 \). 
We take \( I \) as the vector space in this case, and 
we need to construct a map such that the 
two fibres form a direct sum.  
</p>
<p> 
To do this, take a circle. At each point 
\(p\) in the circle, we need to find a way 
to construct two fibres which have a direct sum locally. 
To do this, we parametrise going round the circle 
with \( \theta \in [ 0 , 2 \pi ] \), and assign 
two vectors 

\[ U _1  = ( \cos ( t / 2) , \sin ( t / 2) ), \quad U _ 2 ( - \sin ( t/ 2), \cos ( t/2 ) ) \] 
The first vector, as a line sub-bundle, traces the outside of a Mobius strip. 
It is a sub-bundle of a Mobius strip. Similarly, the second vector 
evolves the same way. 
Together, the fibre is isomorphic to \( \mathbb{ R } ^ 2 \), 
and so it is the trivial two dimensional tangent bundle on \( S ^ 1 \). 
</p> 

<h3>An alternative approach using transition functions</h3> 
<p>
This can alternatively 
be shown by looking at the 
transition functions for the individual Mobius strips. 
A fibre bundle is trivial when we 
can take the transition function to be written as a factor of two 
structure group elements. 

\[ t_ {12} (x )  = g _ 1 ( x) g _ 2 ( x ) \] 
Without loss of generality we require that 
\( g _ 2 \) is a smooth map with \( g _ 2 ( x _ 1 ) = I, g_ 2 ( x_2 ) = - I \)
on the place where the transition function is taken to not be 
the identity map on a single strip. 
However, this is a map in \( GL ( 2 , \mathbb{ R} ) \), so we're 
okay since this is connected. On the Mobius strip alone, 
the group \( Z _ 2 \) is not connected and not a Lie group.   
<p>

<p> 
For the case in which we are working 
with just a single Mobius band, we cannot call the group function  \( g(x_1) = x_1, \, g(x_2) = - x \) trivialisable 
on the different sections of the mobius strip since this group is not connected, 
and so this operation is not smooth. However, we are at liberty to do this 
when we are working with the direct sum.
