<p>These are notes taken inline with the HEP/GR courses on offer in Part III Mathematics. 
None of this content is original, but I have taken liberties to explain things differently 
from what is lectured, to practice exposition. In addition, I include content not lectured, such as supplementary 
material from textbooks, online, or my own derivations when appropriate. </p>

 
<a href=/static/notes/3_SFP/article.pdf ><h2>Group Theory in Particle Physics
</h2></a>
<p>In this set of notes, we explore the relationships
between group theory and particle physics. 
We do this via the language of Lie groups, which 
are groups of transformations where we can move smoothly from one 
to another.

<a href=/static/notes/1_QFT/article.pdf ><h2>Quantum Field Theory
</h2></a>
<p>Quantum field theory is humanity&#39;s most successful attempt 
(so far) to combine quantum mechanics with Einstein&#39;s theory of special relativity. 
It solves a host of problems in quantum mechanics such as the issues of causality and
action at a distance. 
In quantum field theory, we don&#39;t treat particles as solid objects, but instead as 
excitations of an oscillator.

<a href=/static/notes/4_SFT/article.pdf ><h2>Statistical Field Theory
</h2></a>
<p>Nature exhibits an amazing phenomena called universality, which is the 
principle that seemingly unrelated phase transitions actually exhibit very similar 
behaviour near critical points. The canonical example are the critical exponents in 
magnetism and the phase transition between liquids and gases. This set 
of notes attempts to explain this via the language of the renormalisation group - a method 
which describes how physics changes at different length scales.

<a href=/static/notes/6_AQFT/article.pdf ><h2>Advanced Quantum Field Theory
</h2></a>
<p>Notes on quantum field theory in more detail. 
Specifically, these set of notes contains detail on the path integral formalism 
of quantum field theory. 
</p>

<a href=/static/notes/5_BH/article.pdf ><h2>Black Holes
</h2></a>
<p>Black holes are violent objects which arise from a space-time singularity.
This is when the gravitational pull of a region of space is so powerful, not 
even light can escape. These set of notes will go through the formation 
and properties of black holes.

<a href=/static/notes/7_STR/article.pdf ><h2>String Theory
</h2></a>
<p>A working theory of quantum gravity! 
</p>  
<hr class="thin">
 
<a href=/static/notes/2_GR/article.pdf ><h2>General Relativity 
</h2></a>
<p>General relativity is a theory of gravity. 
It&#39;s a system based on geometry that says gravity comes from dips and warps in spacetime. 
General relativity helps us predict a range of 
previously unexplained phenomena, like the funky orbits of mercury, light that bends, time dilation 
and more. 
It was developed by Albert Einstein in the beginning of the 20th Century.
