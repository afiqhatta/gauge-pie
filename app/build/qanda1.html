<h3>A cross-product identity with non-commuting operators</h3>

<p>
An explicit calculation is as follows. First, we need to observe that the operators \(  a_ i \)  and \( b_ i \) do not commute, so we can only switch the ordering of the operators at the expense of a commutator. 
We also employ the identity 
$$ \epsilon_{ij k    } \epsilon_{ ilm  }  = \left(  \delta_{ jl  } \delta _{ km  } - \delta _{jm } \delta_{ kl} \right) $$ 

The only thing to do now is to write out the vector expression explicitly in terms of its components, and then shift the operators one by one to get things in the right order. 
\begin{align}
	\left( \vec{a} \times \vec{b} \right) \cdot 
	\left(  \vec{a} \times \vec{b}  \right) &=  
	 \epsilon _{ij k} \epsilon_{ ilm } a_j b _k a _l b _ m \\  
						&=  \left( 
						\delta _{ jl } \delta_{ km  }  - \delta _{ jm } \delta _{ kl  } \right)  a _ j b _ k a _ l b _ m  \\
						&=  a _j b _ k a _ j b _ k 
						 - a _ j b _ k a _ k b _ j \\
		&=  a _ j \left[  b _ k , a _ j   \right]  b _ k  
		+ | \vec{a} | ^ 2 | \vec{b} | ^ 2 
		 - a_ j \left[  b  _k , a _ k   \right]  b _ j 
		  - a _ j a _ k b _ k b _ j \\ 
		 &=  a _ j \left[  b _ k , a _ j  \right]  b _ k  + | \vec{a} | ^ 2 | \vec{b} | ^  2  - a _ j \left[  b _ k , a _ k   \right]  b _ j 
		  - a _ j a _ k \left[  b _ k , b _ j  \right]  
		   - a _ j a _ k b _ j b _ k \\
		    &= a _ j \left[  b _ k , a _ j   \right]  b _ k 
		    + | \vec{a} | ^ 2 | \vec{b} | ^ 2  - a _ j \left[  b _ k, a _ k   \right]  b _ j  - a _j a _ k \left[  b _ j , b _k    \right]  
		     - a _ j \left[  a _ k , b _ j   \right]  a _ k \\
		      & - \left( \vec{a} \cdot \vec{b}  \right)  ^ 2  \\ 
\end{align}
Now, all you have to do is switch around the ordering in the commutators to get the correct signs in the expression used in the question.

<h2>The covariant derivative in non-Abelian Lie groups</h2>
<p>
I thought I might add some context to this question and generalise this to the **general** case for an arbitrary non-Abelian Lie group. You might be pleased to know there is a **standard** set of transformations one has for each type of field that pops up in our theory. 

Suppose we are working in standard $\mathbb{ R } ^ {1, 3 } $ spacetime with the Minkowski metric, and are looking at theories with a gauge symmetry given by a Lie group $ G $, with a corresponding Lie group $ \mathcal{L} ( G ) $. Also suppose that our representation of the Lie group is given by $ R : G \to \text{Mat} _ n ( \mathbb{ C } ) $. Let the associated representation of the Lie algebra be denoted by $ D : \mathcal {L } (G ) \to \text{ Mat } _ n (\mathbb{ C } ) $, where $ n $ is the dimension of our representation space.  

 Then, in non-Abelian gauge theory, we have that our scalar field is actually a map from this spacetime to the representation space of our Lie group. In other words, 

$$ \phi : \mathbb{ R } ^ { 3 , 1} \to V $$ and under a transformation of some element $ g \in G $ which is generated by the element $ X  \in \mathcal{ L } ( G ) $, we have that our scalar field transforms as 
$$ \phi \to R ( g ) \phi = \exp \left( D ( \epsilon X ) \right) \phi \implies \delta \phi = \epsilon D(X) \phi  $$
Our vector field $ A _ \mu $ in the covariant derivative is in fact a map from our spacetime to our Lie algebra, and infinitesimally the change is given by  
$$ \delta A _ \mu  = - \epsilon \partial _ \mu X + [ X , A_\mu ] $$ 
Now you should find that, if we define our covariant derivative as 
$$ D_\mu  = \partial _ \mu + D ( A _ \mu ) $$ then after a bit of computation you will always find that under an infinitesimal transformation we have that our covariant derivative of the scalar field is given nicely (and what we want) as 
$$ \delta ( D _ \mu \phi ) = \epsilon D ( X ) \phi $$ 
</p>

<h2> The general form of the Lorentz transform </h2>
<p>
Just wanted to provide a geometrical interpretation of what's going on here, perhaps without resorting to an exact form of a Lorentz transformation! In special relativity, we are ultimately analysing the **geometry** of $\mathbb{R}^{1, 3}$ under the **Minkowski** metric. That is to say, we are looking at time dimension and space dimensions and putting them on the same footing as each other but with a measure of distance defined as
$$ ds^ 2 =  - d t ^ 2 + d x ^ 2 + d y ^ 2 + d z ^ 2 $$
This means that given two 4-vectors in this space, say $ x ^ \mu $ and $ y ^ \mu $, we treat their contraction much like an inner product in Euclidean space, but instead we are computing $ x \cdot y   = \eta _{\mu \nu } x ^ \mu y ^ \nu $ where
$$ \eta_{\mu \nu } = diag(- 1 , 1 , 1, 1 ) $$
So, we have a meaningful notion of the norm of $ x $, where
$$ x \cdot x  = x ^ \mu x ^\nu \eta_{\mu \nu } $$
Now to answer the question. A Lorentz transform is defined as a transformation **which preserves the norm of any four vector**.  So, if we do the Lorentz transform $ x ^\mu \to \Lambda ^ \mu _{ \ \ \nu}  x ^ \nu$,
where $\Lambda $ is some matrix, it must preserve our norm for arbitrary $ x ^ \mu $, so
$$ \lambda ^ \mu _{ \, \, \rho } \eta ^{ \rho \sigma } \Lambda^ \nu _{\, \,  \sigma }  = \eta ^{\mu \nu}. $$ In other words, it's any member of the group $ O(3, 1 ) $, which is the space of transforms which preserve norms under the Minkowski metric.
