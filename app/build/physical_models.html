<h2> Material Point Methods </h2> 

<p>I think it is an amazing fact of life that humans can computationally model physical systems with such a high degree of accuracy. Perhaps more importantly for me, a good physical animation model just looks inspiring. This post is dedicated to some of the mathematical and computational methods which go into a high quality physically based animation. 

In particular, I will start with a discussion on general continuum mechanics, and then outline some algorithms which are used for physically based modelling.

<h3> The basic language of continuum mechanics </h3> 

<h4>  What is the framework in which we describe how particles move in the first place? What is the language in which we analyse how a system evolves? </h4>  
<p> 
Well, the first natural thing to do 
would be to define some set in which particles 
lie at some given time. 
In this article, we start with an initial set of particles 
at time zero, and we will call this domain \( \Omega^ 0 \subset \mathbb{ R } ^ d \). 
Similarly, the set of particles at a given time \( t \) will lie 
in a domain \( \Omega ^ t \subset \mathbb{ R} ^ d \). 
Now, in studying deformations, we are 
precisely looking at how particles move from 
the domain at the initial time \( t = 0 \) to 
the domain at some given time \( t \).
</p> 

<p> 
How do we then denote specific particles in these domains? 
Well, the notation which we will use throughout this article is 
that the vector \( \mathbf{ X }  \) shall denote some arbitrary position 
of a particle in our initial time domain \(  \Omega ^ 0 \). 
And, at some reference time \( t \), the position of a particle shall be denoted 
with the small case vector \(  \mathbf{ x } \). 
</p>

<p>
Now that we have a starting point, 
what is the language we use to describe a deformation? 
Well, we use a map called a deformation map \( \phi( - , t ) : 
\Omega^0 \to \Omega^ t  \)
which takes a point \( \mathbf{ X }   \) 
in our initial domain and maps it to the point \(  \mathbf { x} \)  
as follows 

$$ \mathbf { x }  = \phi ( \mathbf { X } , t ) $$
This is already a good starting point to define some 
basic transformations on a body of material. 
For example, we can describe a rotation of 
using the deformation map 
$$ \mathbf { x }  = \mathbf{ R } \mathbf { X } $$ 

</p> 
<p>
From this, we can define, based on some initial configuration \(  \mathbf { X }  \), 
the velocity and acceleration simply by differentiating the 
deformation map with respect to time. It is important to note that these 
maps are still reliant on 
our initial configuration \(  \mathbf { X } \), so we  
call this the Lagrangian point of view. 
\begin{align} 
\mathbf { V } ( \mathbf{ X }, t )  &= \frac{ \partial }{ \partial t } \phi( \mathbf{ X }, t ) \\
\mathbf { A }( \mathbf{ X } , t ) & = \frac{ \partial } { \partial t } \mathbf{ V } ( \mathbf{ X}, t ) 
\end{align}
The Lagrangian point of view is labelled as 
such because since we are always referring to the 
initial vector at \(  t = 0 \), 
we are essentially tracking a single particle as 
we evolve throughout time. 
</p>

<h3> Deformation </h3> 

<p> 
Given our deformation map, we can derive a quantity called the Jacobian, which will 
prove essential in modelling elasticity of our object, 
as well as looking at infinitesimal volume changes. 
The Jacobian is a matrix of partial derivatives, given by 
$$ \mathbf{F}  = \frac{ \partial \phi ( \mathbf { X } , t ) }{ \partial \mathbf { X } } $$ 
Physically, applying this matrix to a 
vector in our initial time domain 
gives us the first order approximated motion. 

</p> 

<h2> Push-forwards, Pull-backs and the material derivative </h2> 

<p> 
Throughout the remainder of this article, we will make the assumption 
that our deformation given by our flow map 
\( \phi \) is a diffeomorphism, which just means that 
this map is smooth and has an inverse. 
So, think of this map as the kinds of 
deformations we can get by moulding play-doh. 
</p> 

<p>
The power of this assumption now means that we can 
switch freely between some a configuration of material 
at some point in time, and a configuration of material 
at our initial time \(  t =0 \). 
We define the lowercase \( \mathbf { v } ( \mathbf { x } ,t ) \)  
to denote our velocity of a particle from the Eulerian point of view, 
which means that we view it from a fixed frame since it's a function 
of \(  \mathbf { x } \), which is a fixed position in a single reference frame. 
</p>

<p>
As an exercise, one can prove that the velocity varies differently with 
respect to time in the Eulerian picture as opposed 
to the Lagrangian picture. 
In the Eulerian picture, our acceleration is the 
material derivative with respect to time of the velocity in the Eulerian picture. 
This is given by
$$ \frac{ D a_ i  ( \mathbf{ x} , t ) }{ Dt } = \frac{ \partial v _ i  ( \mathbf { x } , t ) }{ \partial t } + \frac { \partial v _ i ( \mathbf{ x } , t ) } {  \partial { x _ j } }  v _ j ( \mathbf{ x } ,  t )  $$
</p> 


<h2>Surface integrals for a push-forward</h2> 
We can write a surface integral 
for a function and it's pullback. This is given by 
$$ \int_{ \partial B _ t } h ( \mathbf{ x }, t ) \cdot \mathbf { n } ( \mathbf { x } ) ds = \int_{ \partial B _ 0 } \mathbf{ H} ( \mathbf { X } ) \cdot \mathbf { F } ^ { -  T} ( \mathbf { X } , t )  J ( \mathbf { X } , t )  dS ( \mathbf { X} ) $$ 

<h2> Stress tensors </h2> 
<p> 
There is a thing called the First Piola-Kirchoff stress. 
This is derived from a strain energy density function given by 
$$ \mathbf{ P }  = \frac{ \partial \psi }{ \partial \mathbf { F } }  $$ 
There is a relationship with the 
Piola-Kirchoff stress and the Cauchy stress. 
$$ \sigma  = \frac{ 1}{ J } \mathbf{ P } \mathbf{ F } ^ T $$ 
We have several ways to model \(  \psi \).
