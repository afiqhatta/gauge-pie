<h2>The Casimir effect</h2> 

<p>
If we are given a free scalar field theory, 
then the energy is encoded in the Hamiltonian. 
In momentum space, and in terms of the creation and 
annihilation operators, a Klein-Gordon theory has 
the Hamiltonian 

\[ H = \int d ^ 3 k \,  \omega _ k ( a _ k ^ \dagger a _ k + \frac{ 1 } { 2 } )\]

Contracting this Hamiltonian with the 
vacuum state \( \left| 0 \right\rangle \)
annihilates the first term with the operators, 
but leaves us with the remaining expression 

\[ E \propto \int d ^ 3 k \approx \infty \] 

\( E \) here is the vacuum energy. 
It is clear that this vacuum energy 
can't be observable because it's infinite. 
</p> 

<p> 
For now this is okay. But, 
how do we change this to get some observable phsyics out of this? 
Well, one thing that we can do 
is to contain this oscillator in a box 
and see what happens when we increase the size of the box. 
</p> 

<p> 
Even after doing this, it still looks like the 
force on the walls of this constrained system 
is infinite, which doesn't agree with experiment at all. Thus, there's nothing wrong with the 
actual calculation itself, but something wrong with the physics. 
For example, with high wavelengths, these high frequency modes 
will just pass through the walls. 
</p> 

<h2>Resolving the discrepancies with the Experiment</h2> 

<p> 
To model this, we could for one try to model the interaction 
between the particles and the high frequency modes. 
However, this is probably a  
difficult thing to do. So, we can instead try to form some approximation. 
If different approximations lead us to the same result - then we've found something significant. 
</p>

<p> 
The approximation we will use to 
model the high frequency modes escaping this box 
is called a 'hard cutoff'. We model the energy contained 
in the box assuming that our high frequency modes are surpressed somehow. 
The first thing we could do is 
to regulate by enforcing a limit on the frequency. 
So, we may decide that 

\[ \omega < \Lambda r, \quad \omega_ n  = \frac{ \pi }{ r} n \] 

Our maximum mode in this case obeys 
\[ n _{ max} ( r)  = \lfloor \Lambda r \rfloor \] 

We derive the force from this 
regularisation by then substituting this into 
the expression for the energy, and then 
differentiating that. Casimir in 1948 predicted this force 
as 
\[ F( a)  =  - \frac{ \pi \hbar c }{ 24 a ^ 2 } \] 
</p> 


<h2> Regulator independence </h2> 
<p>
For a wide variety of different procedures 
in which we could have chosen to choose a regularisation scheme, 
it turns out that for a lot of choices, we would have arrived at the same force. 

Casimir shows that this is true in his 1948 paper, 
that the Casimir force is independent of 
the choice of regulator subject to some conditions. 
</p>

<h2> Counterterms</h2> 
<p> 

In physics, it is perfectly possible 
for our zero point energy to be infinite, since its not 
observable. 
To get physics out of the zero point energy, 
we need to place it in the context of wider space parameterised 
by some large boundary, then take the limit of this boundary to 
infinity. 
</p> 

<p> 
In a box, the energy 
can be decomposed into the extrinsic energy and the residual force. 
In the general box, our energy as a function of 
the size of the box is given by 
\[ E ( r)  = \frac{ \pi } { 2 } r \Lambda ^ 2 - \frac{ \pi } { 24 r } + \dots \] 

The first term represents the free space, non-observable energy. 
We can cancel this out by adding in a counterterm, which is a 
freely defined unnmeasurable additional term, which can 
be used in the intermediate steps to compute physical quanties.

<h2>Renormalising a scalar quantum field theory</h2> 
<p> 
Suppose we wanted to compute the 
cross section of two particles interacting 
in the theory where the Lagrangian looks like 

\[ L = -  \frac{ 1 } { 2} \phi \box \phi  -  \frac{\lambda}{4! }  \phi ^ 4 \] 
The second order correction to this 
term is infinite and diverges. 
It is a single loop diagram which diverges, and 
is a function of the four momentum going in.  
To make it manageable, we differentiate the integral 
then reintegrate it. 
</p> 

<p> 
With the second order correction, 
our cross section is then 
\[ M ( s )  =  - \lambda - \frac{ \lambda ^ 2 } { 32 \pi ^ 2 } \ln \frac { s } { \Lambda ^ 2 } \] 

We have an infinite quantity. We resolve this 
by realising that the 
observed coupling occuring at a particular centre of mass 
energy satisfies the relation, to first order 
\[ \lambda _R  = \lambda + \frac{ \lambda ^ 2 } { 32 \pi ^ 2 } \ln \frac{ s_ 0 } { \Lambda ^ 2 } + \dots \]
In this case, \( \lambda _ R \) is the renormalised observable quantity. 
</p> 

<p> 
Once we write out this in terms of \( \lambda _ R \), 
we can now solve, and get an expression in terms 
of observable quantities.  
</p> 

<p> 
To recap, we found that even though 
the energy of a system in total maybe infinite, 
we have a finite residual quantity. 
We foudn that even though the energy of this system 
was infinite and a function of our high energy cutoff, 
the residual phsyics popped out as finite. The high energy cutoff was required
to restrict ultra high frequency radiation.
