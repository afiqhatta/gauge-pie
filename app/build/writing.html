</h2></a>
<p>In classical game theory, a set of players each choose a strategy. This leads to a set of payoffs given to each player. In a quantum game, players do strategies by applying quantum gates on a given state. This changes our dynamics significantly from the classical case.

In this article, we&#39;ll be looking at some models and 
techniques that can be used to study this phenomena.

<a href=/fast_latex.html ><h2>Talk: Writing TeX faster than you can write. 
</h2></a>
<p>Title: How to Tex as fast as you write! 
Speakers: Afiq Hatta and Umut Ozer 

TeX is good, but can be slow and error prone to write. What if there was away to remove 
the trade-off between pretty typing, and the time spent doing it? 
In this talk, we&#39;ll be demonstrating the methods that will enable you to be able to
TeX a lecture in real time! (Or at least, go much faster than you did before). 

We will cover: 
- basic vim (the monster of all text editors) 
- downloading plugins to handle TeX in vim 
- using UltiSnips to set shortcut expressions for insanely fast typing
- how to get the code which ALREADY has a bunch of intuitive shortcuts (courtesy of Gilles Castel) 

We&#39;re talking key maps like `a -&gt; \alpha, and // -&gt; \frac{}{}. 

You should come if: 
- You want to improve the speed and accuracy of your Tex coding. 
- Want to TeX faster for essays (Part III essay), research or just to store math in a more permanent way. 

No prerequisites required! 

NB: A lot of this talk will revolve around the viral blog post Gilles Castel wrote several months ago.  
We kindly have his permission to share the stuff he has made (with some of our own edits as well)!
