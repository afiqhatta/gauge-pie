<a href=/policy_uncertainty.html ><h2>Examining Policy Uncertainty in Malaysia
</h2></a>
<p>I scrape Malaysian news data to get a feel for the public&#39;s uncertainty in policy.

<a href=/landau_mechanics.html ><h2>Tricky Calculations in Mechanics
</h2></a>
<p>Landau&#39;s book on mechanics contains problems 
where the explicit calculation is sometimes omitted. 
These calculations are sometimes not obvious. For the ones which I did manage to do, 
I document them in this post.

<a href=/quantum_games.html ><h2>Quantum Games: A short History and Introduction
</h2></a>
<p>In classical game theory, a set of players each choose a strategy. This leads to a set of payoffs given to each player. In a quantum game, players do strategies by applying quantum gates on a given state. This changes our dynamics significantly from the classical case.

<a href=/physical_models.html ><h2>Methods in Physically-based Modelling
</h2></a>
<p>A set of notes on recent interesting developments in the space of 
physically based modelling, computer graphics and physics simulation.

<a href=/strange_metals.html ><h2>Strange metals
</h2></a>
<p>The question of superconductivity is really important 
because efficient wires at low temperature saves energy!
In this article, we&#39;ll be looking at some models and 
techniques that can be used to study this phenomena.

<a href=/qanda1.html ><h2>Amusing Questions and Answers in Physics, Part 1 
</h2></a>
<p>Here I review some interesting questions which I have found on physics stackexchange and physics overflow. There&#39;s a bit of a variety here so sorry if this content seems unstructured!
