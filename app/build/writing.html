<a href=/quantum_games.html ><h2>Quantum Games: A short History and Introduction
</h2></a>
<p>In December 2018, I gave a brief talk at the Department of Physics, Universiti Malaya in Kuala Lumpur. This talk was on short introduction to the history and mechanics. A game is simply a mapping from a space of strategies by two or more players, to a space of payoffs. A simple example of a game would be a each player tossing a fair coin, with each combination corresponding to some payoff to either player. 

This is an example of a classical game, where each player chooses their move unambigiously. In a quantum game however, we have participants prepare quantum states and apply operators to them as moves. This changes the dynamics of games greatly!

<p>The question of superconductivity is really important 
because efficient wires at low temperature saves energy!
In this article, we&#39;ll be looking at some models and 
techniques that can be used to study this phenomena.

<a href=/fast_latex.html ><h2>Talk: Writing TeX faster than you can write. 
</h2></a>
<p>Title: How to Tex as fast as you write! 
Speakers: Afiq Hatta and Umut Ozer 

TeX is good, but can be slow and error prone to write. What if there was away to remove 
the trade-off between pretty typing, and the time spent doing it? 
In this talk, we&#39;ll be demonstrating the methods that will enable you to be able to
TeX a lecture in real time! (Or at least, go much faster than you did before). 

We will cover: 
- basic vim (the monster of all text editors) 
- downloading plugins to handle TeX in vim 
- using UltiSnips to set shortcut expressions for insanely fast typing
- how to get the code which ALREADY has a bunch of intuitive shortcuts (courtesy of Gilles Castel) 

We&#39;re talking key maps like `a -&gt; \alpha, and // -&gt; \frac{}{}. 

You should come if: 
- You want to improve the speed and accuracy of your Tex coding. 
- Want to TeX faster for essays (Part III essay), research or just to store math in a more permanent way. 

No prerequisites required! 

NB: A lot of this talk will revolve around the viral blog post Gilles Castel wrote several months ago.  
We kindly have his permission to share the stuff he has made (with some of our own edits as well)!
