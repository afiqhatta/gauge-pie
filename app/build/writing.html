<a href=/quantum_games.html ><h2>Quantum Games: A short History and Introduction
</h2></a>
<p>In classical game theory, a set of players each choose a strategy. This leads to a set of payoffs given to each player. In a quantum game, players do strategies by applying quantum gates on a given state. This changes our dynamics significantly from the classical case.

</h2></a>
<p>The question of superconductivity is really important 
because efficient wires at low temperature saves energy!
In this article, we&#39;ll be looking at some models and 
techniques that can be used to study this phenomena.
