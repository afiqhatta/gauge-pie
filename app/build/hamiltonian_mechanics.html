<h2> Hamiltonian Mechanics</h2>
	<p>
		Suppose we have a symplectic manifold \( ( M , \omega ) \). 
		If we define a real function from the manifold, \( H: M \to \mathbb{ R } \), 
		then we can construct the one form given by the differential 

		\[ dH = \sum _ i \partial _ i H d x ^ i \] 
		The symp
ectic form \( \omega \) is a two-form which satisfies two properties - non-degeneracy 
		and closedness. Being non-degenerate means that there is no such vector field 
		such that 
		\[ \iota_{X _ H } \omega = d H \] 
	</p> 

	<p> 
		The above fact is true, because it is asking the same question as 
		asking if there is a unique solution to the equation 
		\[ (X _ H ^ \mu \omega _ { \mu \nu } = Y _ \nu \] 
		which holds by the virtue of the fact that 
		the two-form is non-degenerate. 
		This is also equivalent to the idea of mapping the one-form 
		\( dH \) to its respective vector using the musical isomorphism.
	</p> 

	<p> 
		We can make the above rigourous as follows. 
		We are asking for the existence of a map such that, given some real function 
		\( H \) as defined above, we have that for all vector fields \( Y \in T M \), 
		we have that 
		\[ dH (  Y ) = \omega ( X _H , Y ) \]
		To prove the existence, we basically define the map \( X _ H \) as above,
		and we set the following components  
		\[ X _ H ^ \nu  = ( d H ) _ \mu \omega ^{ \nu \mu } \]
		In this case, the omega with raised indices denotes the inverse 
		of the two form \( \omega \), which exists by non-degeneracy.  
	</p> 

	<p>
		Given a vector field, we can 
		generate some diffeomorphism with the following procedure. 
		Given a vector field \( X _ H \), we can generate a class of diffeomorphisms 
		parametrised by the parameter \(t  \in \mathbb{R } \), which is the solution to 

		\[ \begin{cases} 
			\pho _0 & = \text { id } _ M \\ 
			\frac{ d \rho _ t } { dt } \circ \rho _ t ^ { -1 }  &= X _ H 
		   \end{cases} 
		\] 

	</p> 	

<h2> Isoptopies </h2> 	
	<p> 
		Why can we do this? We will define something 
		that makes this clearer. An isotopy is a class of diffeomorpisms 
		which are parametrised by some parameter \( t \in \mathbb { R } \). 
		For a given isotopy, we can find a family of vector fields such that 
		\[ \frac{ d \rho _ t } { dt } = v _ t \circ \rho _ t \]
		It turns out, when \( M \) is compact, there is a one-to-one correspondence 
		between the isotopies of \( M \), and their generating vector fields. 
	</p> 
	<p> 
		This is true, by virtue of being able to map back 
		and forth between them by uniqueness of solutions to differential equations. 
		Given an isotopy, we find the corresponding vector field 
		which is given by \( v _ t = \dot{ \rho} _ t \circ \rho ^ { - 1} _ t \). Given a vector field, 
		we solve this differential equation, and we are done. 
	</p> 

	<p> 
		For a given isotopy, we have the following formulas.
		We can define the Lie derivative as the derivative with 
		respect to time of applying a member of the isotopy class 
		to a form. In the 13th chapter of Lee, this is touched on. 
		We have Cartan's magic formula, which is quoted as 
		\[ L_ X \omega = \iota _ X d \omega + d ( \iota_ X \omega ) \] 
		This can be proved by induction on the degree of forms. We first prove this 
		for zero forms. Since \( \iota _ X f = 0\), we have that 
			\[ L _ X ( f ) = X ( f ) = \iota _ X ( df ) + 0 = \iota _ X (df ) + d ( \iota _ X f ) \]
	</p> 
	<p> 
		To prove this for arbitrary k forms, 
		we will first prove this for 1 forms. We will then work 
		inductively. We will first assume the formula holds true for 
		k-1 forms, and then attempt to reduce a k-form. To prove this for a 1-form, 
		we first observe that in local coordinates, we can 
		write any one form \( \omega = u dv \). 
	</p> 

	<p> 
		To prove that locally, we can write one forms like this, 
		we appeal to the following. 

<h2> Symplectic reduction </h2> 
	<p> 
		This sectionis about reducing the number of degrees of freedom 
		in a given system based on the size of the symmetry group it has. 
		Suppose we have a manifold endowed with some symmetry group \( G \), 
		in the form of a Hamiltonian G-space \( M , \omega, G , \mu \). 
		Then, we can quotient out this space to have a reduced symplectic form and 
		a reduced manifold. 
	</p> 
	<p> 
		For example, we can reduce the complex plane
		with a symmetry \( U ( 1) \). To do this, we construct the 
		symplectic form from the manifold \( \mathbb{ C } ^ n \) 
		\( \omega = \frac{ i } { 2 } \sum dz_ i \wedge d \bar { z } _ i \)
		with a standard symplectic form. We can consider the 
		action of \( S ^ 1 \) on this, and construct a momentum map. 
		If we choose the moment map to be 
		\[ \mu : \mathbb{ C } ^ n \to \mathbb{ R }, \quad z \mapsto  -\frac{ | z | ^ 2 } { 2 }  \]
		From the 1 parameter subgroup generated by the 
		\( S ^ 1 \) symmetry group gives the vector field 
		\[ X ^ { \#}  = \frac{ \partial}{ \partial \theta_ 1 }  + \dots + \frac{ \partial } { \partial \theta _  n } \]
		Now, to prove that this is a moment map, 
		we need to show that this satisfies 
		\[ i _ { X ^ { \# } }  = d \mu \] 
		To do this, we first construct \( X ^ { \# } \). 
		Starting from the vector field \(X ^ { \# } \), we 
		work backwards and find the diffeomorphism associated with 
		the Lie group element \( t \in S^ 1 \). Given that 
		the generating vector field is 
			\[ X ^ { \# } = \frac{ \partial } { \partial  \theta_ 1 } + \dots + \frac{ \partial } { \partial \theta_ n } \], 
		we can compute the corresponding diffeomorphism
		by solving the equation \( \dot{ \theta _ i } = 1 \). 
	</p> 
	<p> 
		For each coordinate \( \theta_i\), the solution to 
		the above differential equation can be found 
		simply as just \( \theta_ i = t + \theta_{i0 } \), which 
		implies that at a given, arbitrary point on 
		the \( \mathbb { C } ^ n \) manifold, call this \(\mathbf{ z} _{init} \), 
		we have that the evolution of this point evolves as 
		\[ z ( t ) = e^ { it } z_{init}  = t ' z_{init} , \quad t ' \in S ^ 1 \]
	</p> 
	<p> 
		Now we need to prove that the 
		moment map satisfies the condition 
		\[ \iota _ { X^ { \#} } \omega = d \mu \]
		To apply the inclusion map on the 
		wedge product, we map use of the identity 
		for an arbitrary wedge product \[ \iota _X ( \alpha \wedge \beta ) = \iota _X \alpha \wedge \beta + ( -1) ^ p \alpha \wedge \iota_ X \beta\] 
	</p> 
	<p> 
		So, to compute the interior product 
		for the bilinear form, we use the product rule above,
		to get that 
		\[ \iota_X \omega = \sum \iota_ X ( r _ i dr_ i ) \wedge d \theta_ i + ( - 1) ^ n 
			r_i ( dr_ i ) \wedge \iota _X  ( d \theta_ i ) \] 
		The first term in the sum reduces to zero, since the element on the right of the wedge 
		has 1-forms associated with the radial coordinate only. For the second term, 
		it is easy to show that the contraction \( \iota_X  ( d \theta_i ) = 1 \), 
		and so since we are dealing with one forms we have that the coefficient in front 
		of this is negative. 
	</p>
	<p>	
		With this in mind, we have a moment map. 
		With the reduction theorem we are about to show, we can 
		construct a reduced space by looking at the inverse of 
		the moment map where it equals zero. The reduced space in this case 
		is defined as the quotient of \( \mu ^ { -1 } ( 0 ) \) by 
		the original Lie group action. In the case 
		above, we have 
		\[ \mu ^ { -1 } ( 0)  / S^ 1  = S^ { 2 n - 1 }  / S ^1  = \mathbb{ C } \mathbb{ P } ^ { n-1} \] 
	</p> 		
	<p> 
		Now we can ask a natural question. 
		If we reduce spaces like this with the procedure above, 
		is the resulting reduced space a manifold? What are its properties? 
		It turns out - the reduced space is indeed a manifold, 
		as a result of the Marsden-Weinstein-Mayer theorem. 
	</p> 

<h2>The Marsden-Weinstein-Meyer Theorem</h2> 
	<p> 
		Suppose we have a hamiltonian G-space 
		for a compact Lie group \( G\). If \( M , \omega, G, \mu \) is 
		a Hamiltonian G-space for a compact Lie group \( G \), then 
		if \( \iota : \mu ^ { -1 } ( 0 ) \to M \) is the inclusion 
		map, then we have that 
		<ul>
			<li> The orbit space \( \mu ^ { -1 } ( 0 ) / G \) is a manifold. </li> 
			<li> \( \pi : \mu ^ { -1 } \to M_{ red } \) is a principle G-bundle </li> 
			<li> There is a symplectic form \( \omega _{ red } \) on the reduced manifold 
				this satisfies the condition that \( \iota^ * \omega  = \pi ^ * \omega_{ red} \) </li>
		</ul> 
	</p>
