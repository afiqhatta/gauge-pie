In their 2006 paper "Kaluza Klein Black Holes with Squashed Horizons", Ken Mastuno and Hideki Ishihara
construct a solution for a electrically charged black hole in five-dimensional Einstein Maxwell theory. 

In that paper, the gauge potential is given as 
\[ A = \pm \frac{ \sqrt 3 }{ 2 } \frac{ k } { r ^ 2 } dt. \]
In this case, \( k\)  is a constant which is related to 
the metric itself. This article will merely be a calculational exercise. I  will merely 
go through an explicit calculation to get the charge associated with this this gauge potential, in 
the far field metric, assuming that the gauge potential has this form.  

We will be integrating over the constant time 
and radial slice of the metric presented in eq (12) of (2006). 

\[ ds^ 2 =  - V dT ^ 2 + \frac{ K ^ 2 } { V } d \rho^ 2 + 
R^ 2 d \Omega_ { S^ 2 } ^ 2 + W^ 2 \chi ^ 2   , \quad R = \rho ^ 2 K ^ 2 , \, W ^ 2 = \frac{ r _ \infty ^ 2 } { 4 } K ^ { - 2},  \, K ^ 2 = \frac{ \rho +\rho_0 }{ \rho } \] 

For details on the meaning of the various constants, refer to the paper.

To do compute a charge in a non-standard space-such as this, I will 
<ul> 
	<li> Compare the gauge potential in this case to the one with Coulomb's law to get a fell first.</li> 
	<li> Outline the metric we are using to integrate over. </li> 
	<li> Compute the electromagnetic field in these new coordinates. </li> 
	<li> Compute the hodge product and do the integrate to get the charge, taking relevant limits. </li> 
	<li> Attempt the above, but with a different metric (the 3 sphere), as well as dicuss whether the charge of an object is radius dependent, philosophically speaking </li> 
</ul> 	

<h3><b>Does this look familiar? </b> </h3> 

<p>
The first interesting to note is that this gauge potential 
already looks similar to Coulomb's law in 3 dimensions. 
In this case, we have an extra power 
on the radial component. Coulomb's law usually 
asserts that \( A \sim  r^ { - 1} dt \), when we write the gauge 
potential as a one-form.
</p>  

<h3> <b> Switching to the appropriate coordinates </b> </h3> 
<p>
First, we change our 
coordinate system to match the coordinates 
used in the metric outlined in eq (12) of (2006). 
We need to be careful to switch both the time and radial components. 
We find that 

\[ \begin{aligned} 
A & = \frac{ \sqrt 3} { 2 } \frac{ 1 } { r ^ 2 } r _ + r _-  dt \\
 & = \frac{ \sqrt 3 } { 2 } \frac{ r_ + r _ - } { r _ \infty ^ 2 } \left ( 1 + \frac{ \rho_ 0 } { \rho } \right) \frac { 1 } { \sqrt { k _ 0 }} d T 
\end{aligned} \] 
</p> 

<p> 
Next, we 
calculate the 
exterior derivative of this object to get the elecetromagnetic field tensor. 
We differentiate with respect to \( \rho \) and attach the wedge. 
We also make use of the substitution, in line (11) of the paper, 
that \( \rho_ 0 / r _ \infty  = \sqrt{ k _ 0 } / { 2 } \) 
This gives us that the 
two form representing the electromagnetic field tensor 
is given by 

\[ 
F =  dA = \frac{ \sqrt  3 } { 4 } \frac{ r _ + r _ - } { r _ \infty \rho ^ 2 } dT \wedge d \rho \]

<h3><b> Computing the hodge dual</b></h3> 
<p> 
It is straightforward to 
show that the metric in the constant radial and time slice, 
as shown in (12) of (2006), 
satisfies the relation

\[ \sqrt { \det g } = \sqrt{ 1 + \frac{ \rho_ 0 } { \rho } } \rho ^ 2 \frac{ r _ \infty } { 2 } \sin \theta  \] 

We can use this to compute the Hodge dual. 
Due to the antisymmetry of the elctromagentic tensor, 
we can just multiply the prefactor of the two form
by the square root of the determinant of the metric 
and this is magically our component that we need for 
the hodge dual. 
We have that 

\[ 
( * F ) _ { \theta \phi \psi } = \sqrt { 1 + \frac{ \rho _ 0 } { \rho } } \left( - \frac{ \sqrt 3 } { 4 } r _ + r _ - \right ) \sin \theta \] 

</p> 
<p> 

The metric defines our range 
for the angular components as \( 0 \leq \theta <  \pi, \, 0 \leq \phi < 2 \pi, \, 0 \leq d \psi <  4 \pi \)  
Now, all we have to do is compute the change by 
integrating over this range, and then we take the radial component in the expression to infinity.  

\[ Q = \frac{ 1 } { 8 \pi G } \int ( * F ) = \frac{ \sqrt 3 r _ + r _ -  }{ 32 \pi G } \int_ 0 ^ \pi   d \theta \sin \theta \, \int_0 ^ { 2 \pi }  d \phi \int_ 0 ^ { 4 \pi }  d \psi  = \frac{ \sqrt 3 } { 2 G } \pi r _ + 
r _ - \] 

</p>

<h3> <b> We seem to get the same results using a standard 3-sphere </b></h3> 
<p> 
Note, in the standard case, 
one can verify that using hyperspherical coordinates over the standard 3-sphere 
with the gauge potential of the same form, 
that we recover the exact same result, without having to integrate 
taking \( \rho \to \infty \) as in the above derivation. 
In other words, in the case of the standard 3-sphere, we 
recover the same handy cancellation for which charge is never a function of 
the radius of the surface at which we integrate it over. 

This is distinct to the case where we have here, 
where integrating over a given radius does alter our charge.

The paper uses a change of 
coordinates to show that the singularity in the 
original metric is spatial infinity. 
This is the coordinate change 
\[ \rho = \rho_0 \frac{ r^ 2 }{ r^ 2 _ \infty - r^ 2 } \]

This leads to a new metric which looks like 
\[ ds^ 2 =  - V dT ^ 2 + \frac{ K ^ 2 } { V } d \rho^ 2 + 
R^ 2 d \Omega_ { S^ 2 } ^ 2 + W^ 2 \chi ^ 2   , \quad R = \rho ^ 2 K ^ 2 , \, W ^ 2 = \frac{ r _ \infty ^ 2 } { 4 } K ^ { - 2},  \, K ^ 2 = \frac{ \rho +\rho_0 }{ \rho } \] 
Since we are just looking to confirm what 
the charge is, we will take \( \rho, T \) 
as constant. This is equivalent to taking a constant time slice, and a constant radius. 
Becuase we are doing this, the only constants we need to concern ourselves
with are \( K , W\) and \( R \). 
In the above, our last two components 
consist of the metric for 
the 2 sphere, as well as another component 
which is added on. We have that 
\[ d \Omega _ { S ^ 2 } ^ 2 = d \theta ^ 2 + \sin ^ 2 \theta d \phi ^ 2 , \quad \chi = d \psi + \cos \theta d \phi \]

Let's now calculate what the 
electromagnetic field for this vector potential is. 
In field theory, the components of the 
electromagentic field tensor, 
given some gauge potential \( A ^ \mu \), is usually written in 
terms of its components as  

\[ F _ { \mu \nu } = \partial _ \mu A _ \nu - \partial \nu A _ \mu \] 

In differential geometry, 
we can actually write the 
gauge potential as a one form, and then compute the 
exterior derivative to get the electromagnetic tensor 
in the form of a two form. 
In terms of our new coordinates, 
our one form is 
\[ A  = \pm \frac{ \sqrt { 3 } }{ 2 } \frac{ k } { r _ \infty ^ 2 } \left( 1 + \frac{ \rho_0 } { \rho } \right) dt \] 

To compute the two-form, 
we compute the exterior derivative 
of this object. The computation of an exterior derivative 
is relatively simple. We compute the 
partial derivatives for each coordinate 
and then put a wedge of that coordinate in front of the component. 
In thise case, our electromagnetic field tensor 
is 
\[ F = dA = \mp \frac{ \sqrt   3} { 2 } \frac{ k } { r _ \infty ^ 2 } \frac{ 1 } { \rho ^ 2 } d \rho \wedge dt \]

<h3> <b> Computing the charge in the metric </b> </h3> 

<p> 
The charge is the integral of the Hodge dual 
of our electromagentic field in the entire space.
We integrate over 
the submanifold which is a constant slice in time, and constant radius. 
First, we compute the determinant 
of the metric in this slice. 
It is easy to show that the angular part of the metric 
has determinant 
\[ \sqrt{\det g }  = R^ 2 W \sin ^ 2 \theta = \rho^ 2 \left( 1 + \frac{ \rho_ 0 } { \rho} \right) \frac{ r _ \infty } { 2 }  \] 

This means that, 
in components, we have that the 
hodge dual of the electromagentic tensor 
is  

\[ (* F ) _{ \theta \phi \psi } = \frac{ \sqrt 3 } { 4 } \frac{ \rho_ 0 k } { r_ \infty } \left( 1 + \frac{ \rho_0 } { \rho } \right) \] 
 
Alternatively, 
we can write the Hodge dual as 
\[ (* F ) _ { \theta \phi \psi } = \frac{ \sqrt 3 } { 2 } \frac{ \rho _ 0 } { \rho _ \infty ^ 2 } \sqrt { ( \rho_ 
+ + \rho _ 0 ) ( \rho _ - + \rho _ 0 ) } \sqrt{ 1  +\frac{ \rho_ 0 } { \rho } } \] 

It is easy to show that 
\[ r_ + r _ =  2 r _ \infty \sqrt{ \rho _ + \rho _ - }, \quad r _ \infty = 2    \sqrt { ( \rho_ 
+ + \rho _ 0 ) ( \rho _ - + \rho _ 0 ) } \] 

Hence, upon doing these substituions, 
we find that our Hodge dual simplifies 
to 

\[ ( * F ) _ { \theta \phi \psi } = \sqrt 3 \sqrt { \rho _ + \rho_ - } \frac{ \sqrt {  ( \rho_ + + \rho _ 0 ) ( \rho _ - + \rho _- ) } } { r _ \infty } \rho _ 0
 = \frac{ \sqrt 3 } { 2 } \rho_ 0  \sqrt { \rho_ + \rho _ - }  \] 

Integrating this over 
the surface implies that 

\[ Q = \frac{ 1 } { 8 \pi G }\int ( * F )  = \frac{ \sqrt 3  \pi \rho _ 0  } { G } \sqrt{ \rho _+ \rho _ - }  \] 

This seems to disagree with the result in 
the paper. 
</p> 
<p> 
our first order of business is to 
construct the 
Questions 
We generally do not expect the charge to dependent around the area of integration - it should be 
well defined. 
The far field case is well defined here; there seem to be no dependence on 
rho as a function. 
I am worried about the non far field case - does it cancel out?
