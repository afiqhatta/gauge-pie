<h3> Immersions and embeddings</h3> 

<p> 
We will motivate this section. 
Then, we will define some important notions, and also look at the equivalence of closed, proper immersions with embeddings. 
We will also touch on what a homeomorphism is, along with some examples. 
Finally, we will go through some references on what are useful resources. 
In particular, a Introduction to Smooth Manifolds by J. Lee is a good resource.

In conjuction with the article on quotient spaces, 
I came across a piece on manifolds and submanifolds, and embeddings. 
Embeddings are just a fancier way of 'slotting in' manifolds in smoothly in Euclidean space - 
can a manifold be smoothly defined as a 'subset' of \( \mathbb{ R } ^ n \), for example?  
I thought it would be interesting to do an article on this in their own right. 
To motivate this article, we seek inspiration from cartography. 
Take a map for example. If we wanted to construct a map  
in 2d where the distance between any two points on the map resembles the distance 
between the actual two points on the sphere, is this possible? 
</p> 

<p> 
To get to grips with the above, we need to formalise under what 
conditions manifolds can be considered 'submanifolds' of higher dimensional 
manifolds. More importantly, we also need to think about 
under what conditions submanifolds might be considered smooth.

<h3> What is an immersion? </h3>
<p>  
An immersion is a map from the manifold to \( \mathbb{ R } ^ n \) 
which preserves the tangent spaces when we look at the derivative at any given point. 
For example, consider an immersion of the circle to \( \mathbb{ R } ^ 2 \). 
If we have an mapping like 

\[ f : x \mapsto ( x^ 2 , x ^ 2 ) \] 
Is this an immersion? Well, in this case the derivative 
at the 0 point is not injective in this case.
