<h3> Immersions and embeddings</h3> 

<p> 
We will motivate this section. 
Then, we will define some important notions, and also look at the equivalence of closed, proper immersions with embeddings. 
We will also touch on what a homeomorphism is, along with some examples. 
Finally, we will go through some references on what are useful resources. 
In particular, a Introduction to Smooth Manifolds by J. Lee is a good resource.

<p> 
In conjuction with the article on quotient spaces, 
I came across a piece on manifolds and submanifolds, and embeddings. 
Embeddings are just a fancier way of 'slotting in' manifolds in smoothly in Euclidean space - 
can a manifold be smoothly defined as a 'subset' of \( \mathbb{ R } ^ n \), for example?  
I thought it would be interesting to do an article on this in their own right. 
To motivate this article, we seek inspiration from cartography. 
Take a map for example. If we wanted to construct a map  
in 2d where the distance between any two points on the map resembles the distance 
between the actual two points on the sphere, is this possible? 
</p> 

<p> 
To get to grips with the above, we need to formalise under what 
conditions manifolds can be considered 'submanifolds' of higher dimensional 
manifolds. More importantly, we also need to think about 
under what conditions submanifolds might be considered smooth.

<h3> What is an immersion? </h3>
<p> 
In order to understand what happens when 
we try to map a manifold 'into a subset' of another manifold, 
we need to construct some sort of smooth map between them. For this purpose, 
the language used to switch between different manifolds is useful.
</p>

<p> 
If we have a smooth map \( \phi : M \to N \) between two manifolds, 
then we can induce a pushforward, \( \phi _ * \), which is an 
induced map between the tangent spaces of the manifolds at a 
given point: 
\[ \phi _ * : T _ p M \to T _ { \phi ( p ) N \] 
If \( M \) and \( N \) are finite dimensional, and 
are parametrised by coordinate systems 
\( \{ x^\mu \} , \{ y ^ \mu \} \) respectively, then 
the specific components of \( \phi _ * \) is just the Jacobian 
in those coordinates. 
\[ \( \phi \) ^ \mu _ \nu  = \frac{ \partial y ^ \mu }{ \partial x ^ \nu } \] 
In this case, this map should be injective if we have more rows than columns. 
</p>

<p> 
An embedding is an immersion which is injective (where the 
map \( \phi \) specifically is injective, but also a homeomorphism onto 
its image, where the image's open sets are defined to be the set of 
open sets in the subspace topology of the target set. 
The subspace topology is defined as all sets which can be written as the 
intersection of the subset \( S \) and an open set in the topology of the 
superset \( X \), where \( S \subset X \). j 
</p>

<p> 
Now, it is not necessarily true that 
an injective map whose range is restricted to its image is a homeomorphsim. 
To be a topological embedding, we require that the inverse is continuous. 
If we consider the map from \( f : [ 0 , 2 \pi ) \] to the unit circle, 
we see that the function \( f \) is continuous because it is composed of 
two continuous maps, and it is bijective. 
However, the inverse map is not continuous since there does not exist a small 
neighbourhood around (0, 1) such that the image of this is contained near 0. 
The neighborhood of (0, 1) always maps to 
a slice which contains 0 and a point arbitrarily close to \( 2 \pi \), but not points inbetween.
Hence, it is not continuous since there does not exist a \( \delta \) such that the image of the map is contained in a small neighbourhood.  
</p> 

<p>
Homeomorphisms preserve the two topological properties 
of connectedness and compactness. 
</p> 

<h3> Examples of embeddings </h3> 
<p> 
The first example of an emebedding 
which is easiest to get our head around is to embed the a lower dimensional 
hyperplane of \(  \mathbb{ R } ^ n \) into \( \mathbbb{ R} ^ m \) where 
\( n \leq m \). The Jacobian of this map is just
the identity matrix with some extra zeros on the bottom. 
The inclusion map is also a homeomorphism, so the inclusion map is indeed an embedding. 
</p> 

<p> 
We have that immersions are embeddings under certain conditions. 
These all stem from whether the injective immersion \( \phi \) is closed or not. 
If it is a closed map, then the mapping is an embedding. 
</p> 

<h3> Embedded submanifolds </h3> 
<p> 
Suppose we have some embedded k-dimensional submanifold 
of \( M \). Given that the original topology of \( M \) is structured such 
that \( M \) is a manifold, is it then true that this k-dimensional submanifold 
is also a topological manifold? Well, it turns out that this is 
indeed true. 
</p> 

<p> 
It's a good exercise to go through the logic 
over why this is true. Suppose we have a subset given \( N \) which is 
a k-dimensional embedded manifold. To prove that this is also a topological manifold, we 
need to construct an atlas from an arbitrary open set 
\( V \) to a subset of the reals. 
Since \( N \) is a topological k embedding, we have that every point 
has a slice chart. A slice chart is a chart of \( M \) (the surrounding manifold), 
such that on \( M \)'s atlas, we have that \( \phi ( U \cap N \) is a k-slice of 
\( \phi ( N ) \). This means that 
locally this subset an be written as 

\[ \phi ( U \cup N ) = \{( x_ 1, x_ 2, \dots x _ k , c_ { k + 1}, \dots c _ n ) \in \phi ( U ) \} \] 
</p> 

<p> 
Since \( M \) is hausdorff and second countable, so is \( N \). Now,
given some \( p \in N \), since \( N \) is an embedded 
submanifold, there exists a slice chart \( U , \phi \), 
such that \( p \in U \), and that \( U \cap N \) is a slice 
of \( U  \).
If we set \( V \) to be the neighbourhood, we have to 
map it via a homeomorphism to a subset of \( \mathhbb{R } ^ k \). 
To do this, we just make use of the 
slice map and then project it down to the first \( k \) coordinates. 
</p> 

\[ \psi = \pi \circ \phi \mid_V : V \to \Im ( \phi \circ \phi \mid _ V ) \] 

<p> 
The inclusion map is a topological embedding itself 
(a homeomorphism with respect to the subspace topology). 
The subspace topology is defined as the set of subsets 
in the subpsace in which there exists an open set in X 
such that the intersection is in the oroginal topology. 

To proe that the inclusion map is an embeeing, 
we need to show that it is continuous from Y to X, 
that it's injective, and that it's open. If we do this, 
then it is a homeomorphism onto its image. 
</p>  

<p>  
An immersion is a map from the manifold to \( \mathbb{ R } ^ n \) 
which preserves the tangent spaces when we look at the derivative at any given point. 
For example, consider an immersion of the circle to \( \mathbb{ R } ^ 2 \). 
If we have an mapping like 

\[ f : x \mapsto ( x^ 2 , x ^ 2 ) \] 
Is this an immersion? Well, in this case the derivative 
at the 0 point is not injective in this case.
