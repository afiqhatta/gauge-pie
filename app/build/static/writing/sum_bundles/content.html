<h2>What does the Whitney sum bundle of a Mobius strip look like?</h2>
<p>
If we have two vector bundles on a given space,
we can construct a <b>Whitney sum bundle</b>, which 
is a space where at every point, the fibres look like 
a direct product of two vector spaces.  
</p> 

<p> 
The simplest way to visualise a direct product is 
taking \( \mathbb{ R } \) as an example - the 
direct sum of the real line with itself is \( mathbb { R }^ 2 \). 
The Whitney sum bundle of a manifold 
is the construct that we get when we combinine two vector bundles 
such that at every point, the fibre is the direct sum 
\( V \oplus W\) of the two vector spaces.  
</p>

<p> 
Moreover, this fibration should 
preserve the properties of the original 
manifold. This means that, when we projecto down, we should still get the base space. 

<h3>Constructing the Whitney Sum</p>
<p>
A Mobius strip is constructed by making a unit interval \( I \) as the 
fibre over the circle \( S ^ 1 \). 
We take \( I \) as the vector space in this case, and 
we need to construct a map such that the 
two fibres form a direct sum.  
</p>
<p> 
To do this, take a circle. At each point 
\(p\) in the circle, we need to find a way 
to construct two fibres which have a direct sum locally. 
To do this, we parametrise going round the circle 
with \( \theta \in [ 0 , 2 \pi ] \), and assign 
two vectors 

\[ U _1  = ( \cos ( t / 2) , \sin ( t / 2) ), \quad U _ 2 ( - \sin ( t/ 2), \cos ( t/2 ) ) \] 
The first vector, as a line sub-bundle, traces the outside of a Mobius strip. 
It is a sub-bundle of a Mobius strip. Similarly, the second vector 
evolves the same way. 
Together, the fibre is isomorphic to \( \mathbb{ R } ^ 2 \), 
and so it is the trivial two dimensional tangent bundle on \( S ^ 1 \).

<p> 
Globally this is a trivial bundle - but not yet sure how to rigourously prove this!
