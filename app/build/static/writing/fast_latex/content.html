In 2019, I gave a brief talk with Umut Ozer on using Ultisnips, Python and vim to rapidly increase 
the speed of typesetting Tex.
Tex is a typesetting system for technical documents. However, as I'm sure many will know, it can be tedious 
to use it when type setting long equations. 
Thankfully, there are patterns and ways in which Tex's use can be optimised.
