The stress of a Cauchy stress of a material is 
an essential thing to compute when running any sort of material 
simulation algorithm. 
For example, knowledge of the Cauchy stress is required 
to compute any type of force update on grid nodes, if the 
algorithm uses sn Eulerian approach. The Cauchy stress \( \sigma \) 
can be conviniently written in terms of the elastic part of 
the deformation gradient. 

\[ \sigma _ F = \frac{ 1 } { J } \frac{ \partial \psi } { \partial \mathbf F _ E } \mathbf F _ E ^ T \] 
 

For snow, Stomakhin et al. (2013) propose that a realistic model has elasto-plastic energy density which can be written as 

\[ \psi ( \mathbf F _ { E } , \mathbf F _ P ) = \mu ( \mathbf F _ P ) | \mathbf F _ E  - U V ^ T | ^ 2  +  \frac{1 } { 2 } \lambda ( \mathbf F _ P ) ( J _ E  - 1) ^2 \] 

where in this case, we can decompose the elastic part of the deformation gradient 
into a singular value decomposition: \( \mathbf F _ { E}  = U \Sigma V ^ T \). In the above, 
\( \mu , \lambda \) are hardening functions called Lame parameters, which are 
functions of the plastic part of our energy density.

A simple computation using the fact that \( \frac{ \partial } { \partial \mathbf F _ E } \det ( J )  = J  \mathbf F _  E ^ { - T } \) 
reveal that our Cauchy stress can be written as 

\[ \sigma = 2 \mu ( \mathbf F _ E  - U V ^ T ) F _ E ^ T + \lambda ( J _ E  - 1 ) J  \] 
In the material point method, Stomakhin clamps the 
eigenvalues of \( \mathbf F _ E \) between critical values, so that plastic deformation is induced 
to occur. 
In practice, we then update these values in an algorithm like MPM.
