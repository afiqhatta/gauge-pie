<p>When we look into the sky, we see that some galaxies emit powerful jets of light. In the 1970s there are a few explanations as to what these things actually were. The model that was use to explain powering galactic nuclei at the time was the existence of either a single super large pulsar, or a cluster of pulsars. However, these models posed problems. One problem was that there is a critical mass for neutron stars, and a neutron star large enough to emit the amount of light would be too big to exist. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>One way that the paper [1] tries to resolve this problem, was to see if a black hole could emit jets of light. For this to happen, we need there to be particles near the magnetosphere of the black hole. Material that accretes near a black hole will probably be magnetised. Near the magnetosphere, there must be some source of particles. The mechanism to explain this is electron-positron pair production . </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>In the paper [1], they consider black holes which are magnetised, and that have an accretion disc. Currents flowing in an equatorial disc that support the magnetic field. This disc can be fuelled by gravity, but it can also be fuelled by magnetism. A plasma is a soup of charged particles. A force-free magnetosphere is a magnetic field with a negligible plasma pressure contribution, but a significant magnetic pressure contribution. To model this, we look at pulsars. </p>

<h3>How does pair production work? Learning from Pulsars</h3>
<p>For a magnetosphere to exist, we need a current. Currents are carried by charged particles, but where do they come from in this situation? We need a way for charged particles to be created  and therefore charged particles to carry it. A work function is the amount of energy needed to remove an electron from a solid to the vacuum outside. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>This plot below is a cross section of a black hole with an accretion disk. in the magnetosphere, we have pair production - a photon decays into a positron and an electron. The position then falls into the black hole. This results in a net current flowing into the black hole. This pair  production can occur outside the event horizon. There are some conditions for this to happen, based on some properties that the black hole needs to have. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>There will be some charge density in the centre. This charge density induces a potential difference. This potential difference induces pair production. The potential difference across a gap h accelerates the electron, and it reaches high enough energy to emit a photon by a curvature process.  Once it curves, it creates an electron position pair, and then the process starts again. This continues to occur until we yields electron energies with a coefficient of </p>

<h3>Electromagnetic equations</h3>
<p>The electromagnetic field is characterised by the electromagnetic field tensor. The dynamics of a magnetosphere around a neutron star is derived in [4] It is the antisymmetric derivative of the vector potential. The electromagnetic field, by default, already solves Maxwell’s equations. In a force-free magnetosphere, it satisfies the equation </p>

<p>We can describe a black hole with a metric. A metric can be expressed with several different coordinates. One popular choice of metric that is appropriate for this analysis are Boyer-Lindquist coordinates. </p>
<p>[image is not supported]</p>
<p>The metric gives us a connection, and this connection gives us the covariant derivative. The covariant derivative is what is used to calculate the electromagnetic tensor. In these coordinates, we can re-write the force-free condition explicitly. In this set of coordinates We can write out the above law explicitly. </p>

<p>In a torus, the toroidal direction revolves around the disk sideways. The poloidal direction revolves around the disk from up to down. In the above, keeping A_phi constant defines poloidal field surfaces. Ferraro’s law of isorotation states that in a steady, axisymmetric flow and magnetic field, the angular speed is constant along the field. This is represented in the equation below. The magnetic field is represented by In other words, we have that </p>

<p>In the paper [1], a generalisation of Ferraro’s law is given in relativistic coordinates. </p>

<h3>Polarised Light Emitted from Black Holes</h3>
<p>he picture below shows an image of the M83 black hole. The black hole is the dark mass at the centre. There is something interesting here - there are long ‘streaks’ of light that look like they are spiralling out of this black hole. This means that the light is polarised, and it is evidence that there are large jets of energy coming out of it. Polarised light means that the waves or oscillating along a common axis. </p>
