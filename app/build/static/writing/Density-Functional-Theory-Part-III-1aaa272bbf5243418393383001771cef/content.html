<p>In the previous section, we tried to prove a correspondence between two physical objects. The first object was the electron density of the ground state, which roughly describes how packed electrons are in the lowest energy state. The second object was the shape of the external potential that we place our electron gas in. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We showed that if we knew the external potential v(r), then we could back out the number density function of the ground state. The ground state is a functional of the external potential, since the information is enough to determine what the ground state is. Also, the external potential fixes the Hamiltonian. This means that the Hamiltonian can be characterised by the ground state energy density, and so can the ground state. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>In turn, the kinetic and potential energy are also functionals of the ground state energy. This means that we can come up with a term that encodes the kinetic and potential energy. In the last equality, we can conclude that this term is a functional of the electron density function b ythe reasoning in the paragraph. </p>

<p>This means that we can define the corresponding full energy, but this time as a functional of the ground state density. </p>

<p>If we know the correct ground state density, then E_v[n] assumes the correct energy of the ground state.</p>

<p>We can separate out the coulomb force from the total energy functional. It is slightly easier to solve for the ground state if we take out the coulomb force in this expression. </p>

<h3>One Particle Density Matrices</h3>
<p>In the above, we can rewrite the function G in terms of one particle density matrices. A single particle density matrix can be written as follows </p>
<p><img alt="alt text" src="static/Density-Functional-Theory-Part-III-1aaa272bbf5243418393383001771cef_file_5.png" /></p>
<p>There is also another object called a two-particle density matrix. This object is quite similar, it is given by the expression </p>
<p><img alt="alt text" src="static/Density-Functional-Theory-Part-III-1aaa272bbf5243418393383001771cef_file_6.png" /></p>
<p>There are two particle creation operators here, placed on after the other, which is why it’s called a two-particle density matrix. With this object, we can write the functional F in a slightly different form. Previously, I said that this term was the sum of the kinetic energy and the interaction term. The kinetic energy is the second term in the sum below, but I’ve re-written it in terms of two different variables, r and r’. The interaction term is the third term in the sum below. If also added two terms which net out, the first term and the last term. These terms look like the ‘classic’ Coulomb electric potential between two electrons. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>There is also another associated operator called the correlation function. Writing out the sum like this allows us to group the last terms together. </p>
<p><img alt="alt text" src="static/Density-Functional-Theory-Part-III-1aaa272bbf5243418393383001771cef_file_7.png" /></p>
<p>In the expression above, the last term looks like a correlation function. The correlation function is similar to the correlation function you’d see in regular probability theory. </p>
<p><img alt="alt text" src="static/Density-Functional-Theory-Part-III-1aaa272bbf5243418393383001771cef_file_8.png" /></p>
<p>If you notice, the last two terms in the sum above are precisely this correlation function. From this, we can see that the final form of this function looks like the sum of a classical Coulomb force, as well as the derivative of the particle density matrix and a correlation term. </p>

<p>The last two terms are of particular interest. We will refer to the sum of the last two terms as the functional called G. </p>

<p>What is this functional used for? One of the things we can do is compute the energy of the lowest energy ground state. </p>

<h3>A Gas of Almost Constant Density</h3>
<p>In the previous section, we went through some effort to define some functionals of interest. In general, we don’t expect to able to compute these things easily. However, we can try simplify things a bit. Now, we want to see what happens when we try to calculate the functional for some simple cases. What happens when we consider a gas of pretty much constant electron density, except with some small fluctuations. </p>

<p>What is the G functional for a density function with this form? We can do an approximation by expanding this object out, much like a Taylor expansion. In the below expression, the first term is the functional of the constant density field. The second term is the quadratic term. There is no linear term. </p>

<p>You may have noticed that there are no This single particle density matrix </p>
