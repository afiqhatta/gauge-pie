Let's first warm up with some differential 
geometry. Given a manifold \( M \), we 
can take a point \( p \) on the manifold 
and then define a tangent space on it. This tangent space 
is has a basis of vectors, which are differential operators 
which take a function defined on the manifold, to the derivative 
in that given direction.

<p> 
For example, let's take a two sphere. 
We can parametrise the upper hemisphere of the two 
sphere in terms of coordinates \( \theta, \phi \), 
and define a function \( f : S ^2 \to S ^ 2 \) locally 
around the point \( p \) that is differentiable. 
For example, we may wish to define  
\[ f ( \theta , \phi ) = \frac{ \theta } { \phi} , \quad \phi \neq  0 \] 
In this case, we could apply the vector 
\( X = \partial _ \theta \) at the point \( p = ( 1, 1) \), 
and this would spit out a real number. 
</p> 

<p> 
The tangent space is a vector space. 
Like all vector spaces, we can define the dual vector space which 
is the space of linear maps from the vector space. 
This is also called the space of one forms. 
We can wedge one forms together which, 
is the antisymmetric sum of the tensor 
product of the one forms. 
This is called the exterior product, and 
is akin to the cross product in a vector space. 
For example, the 
exterior product is 
\[ dx^ 1 \wedge dx ^ 2 = dx^ 1 \otimes dx ^ 2 - dx^ 2 \otimes dx ^ 1 \]

The vector bundle is a space 
in which every point on the manifold locally looks like a product space 
with a vector space. By this, we mean that 
a vector bundle \( E \) can be characterised by 
a map \( E \to M \) such that for all \( m \in M \), 
the inverse map applied to a single point looks like a vector space.
The easiest example to grasp is just \( R ^ 2 \) for example. 

Take \( M = \mathbb { R } \), and construct the map 
\[ \mathbf { R } \times \mathbf { R } \to \mathbf { R } \] 
by just projecting down into the first coordinate. 
Furthermore, we also notice that the inverse of a local neighbourhood of 
the target manifold also looks like a product space locally.

A principle bundle is a group theoretic version of a
vector bundle. Similarly to a vector bundle, 
it is a space endowed with a projection 
into the base manifold. However, 
in this case, if we have a point on the manifold - the 
inverse no longer needs to be a vector space. It 
is instead a Lie group. 

For the principle bundle, we have a smooth and 
free group action acting on the bundle. In addition, 
the projection must be a fibration - that is, 
the inverse must be a group orbit acting on a point. 
The Lie group acts on the point in the manifold freely.

<h2>Basic group theory</h2> 
<p> 

Suppose we have a space, such as a manifold. 
We can transform this space according to a group action. 
A group action of a group \( G \) onto a space 
\( X \) is a mapping 
\[ \phi : G \times X \to X \] 
which satisfies a few axioms. Firstly, the 
idenitity element acting on the space should do nothing 
to the space. Secondly, the 
composition of transformations should 'make sense', 
in the sense that combining two group transformations should essentially be a 
homomorphism. In other words, we should have 
that 
\[ \begin{aligned} e \cdot x & = x \text{ for all } x \in X \\ g \cdot ( h \cdot x )  &= ( g \cdot h ) \cdot x, \quad \forall g, h \in G, \, \forall x \in X \end{aligned} \]
In other words, group actions are a homomorphism from 
a group to the set of transformations of a set \( X \), where 
the binary operation on the set of transformations of a given set is just 
function composition.

A free group action is 
an action in which for all \( g \in G \), 
if there exists a fixed point, then the point is the identity. 
There is a

A princple bundle is a fibration of 
a manifold which has some associated group action. 
A vector bundle is a manifold with a fibre which locally looks like a vector 
space.

Lie groups are groups which 
have a manifold structure - the group can 
be parametrised in terms of a set of coordinates 
on some space. Cartan classified these kinds 
of groups in the Cartan classification, which includes 'exceptional groups' 
which don't fall into any sort of classification. 
Funnily enough, these groups have nice applications in theoretical physics.

\( G _ 2 \leq GL ( 7 , \mathbb { R } ) \) is a 14 dimensional Lie group represented by 
the Dynkin diagram with two nodes and three arrows. The manifold associated 
with the Lie group is semi-simple, simply connected and 14 dimensional. 
Lie groups can be defined in terms of forms which they leave invariant.

How does the a group action act on an n-form? 
For example, for a 3 dimensional manifold, we can 
define the n-form 
\[ F = dx \wedge dy + dy \wedge dz + dz \wedge dx \] 
How does a group action apply to this? Well, one 
thing we can do is to apply Cartan's magic formula to 
see if the forms are invariant under the Lie derivative.
