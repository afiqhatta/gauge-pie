<p> 
In December 2019, I sat down with 
Dr. Nurfikri Norjoharuddeen, who was then at the time 
the newly appointed head of the National Centre for Particle Physics (NCPP). 
The NCPP coordinates experimental particle phsyics research nationally in Malaysia. 
Fikri and I spoke briefly about his new role. He has an impressive background - a Master's from UCL and a PhD from Oxford, both in Physics. 
</p>

<p> 
I thank him for taking the time to speak to me. 
</p>  

<h3>Did you feel like you were ready to enter the role at such a young age?</h2> 

<p> 
I'm honored, but the NCPP is quite young. 
We started off in 2013, so we're still a small group. 
Right now, we have two physicists in Universiti Malaya, 
one in UKM and one in UPM. 
So, it's not too much of a big role to say the least. I am mostly 
involved in coordinating and organising. 
</p> 

<p> 
At the end of the day
most of the particle physics is in UM itslef. For example, 
the CMS experiment is here, where as COMET is divided between UM and UTM. 
The main challenge is finding funding every year. 
Right now I'm trying to get funding from the government, 
but funding is coming from UM itself. 
</p> 

<h3> Could you outline some of the main project that Malaysia is currently contributing to?</h3> 
<p> 
We are actively in 3 collaborations. 
Frist is the Compact Muon Solenoid experiment in the large hadron collider. 
The second one is the Bell 2 experiment in Japan, dedicated to studying B-phsyics. 
The, we have the COMET experiment headed by Osaka University, which is the smallest experiment we are involved in. 
There is a fourth experiment but we've been inactive since 2007. It's called the Zeus experiment, which was an 
electron proton experiment in DESY. This experiment has already been decomissioned. 

<h3> Can you go through some of the experiments that are involved in the CMS?</p> 
<p> 
We've been quite active in searches for new physics. 
We are concerned with analysis called 'Vanilla searches'. 
(6:07) These are seaarches that are the bread and butter of 
the experimental particle physics, where the signatures are as simple as possible. 
</p> 

<p> 
We have a PhD student who is working on trying to find heavier
Higgs Boson particles - extensions to the Higgs mechanism. We are looking into new signatures in 
which these particles decay into two muons. 
In the LHC, detecting two muons is relatively easy. 
We look for bumps in the mass spectrum. 
</p> 

<p> 
Slightly more complex, is what I am doing. 
I'm looking for resonances of particles that decay into two particles, 
one of  
either a Higgs Boson, Z boson or the W boson. 
One of them might decay into two jets, while the other will decay into leptons
like muons or electrons. 
</p> 

<p> 
For now, we don't really care 
what kind of phsyics we might find. 
We are just looking for anything that does not match up with what we expect. 
</p> 

<h3> In terms of STEM subjects, Malaysians culturally has a push towards more engineering-type subjects. What made you want to do physics?</h3> 
<p> 
Personally I found engineering boring. People never really say what makes 
engineering interesting. With the natural sciences, it's not hard to get excited. 
I found the questions in natural sciences to be grander in nature. 
For example, in Biology, one may ask 'What is life?'. In phsyics, 
one my ask 'What is the smallest thing that exists'? 
Simple, yet grand questions. 
</p> 

<h3> Why don't you think that more Malaysians pursue fundamental sciences then?</h3> 
<p> 
I honestly think this is 
because teachers don't tell students that there's more 
to physics than what's taught at school. 
I never had that kind of exposure. I got my exposure pretty much 
from popular books or magazines. 
</p> 

<p> 
If we gave more exposure and excitement 
to students, they would more likely try out the 
fundamental sciences. 
I've met people who basically just don't know what's out there. 
Value-wise, however, people will tend to prefer things 
that are the end of the day, utilitarian - whether they got a job or not. 
</p> 

<p> 
Because of social media, however, I think 
it's getting better. I've met some kids who know about the LHC nowadays. 
</p> 

<p> 
Secondly, in Malaysia, we don't really have role models. 
A lot of school kids think that there is great science out 
there, but they think its beyond their reach because they don't see Malaysians doing it. 
</p> 

<h3> Do you have any Malaysian physicists that inspire you? </p> 

<p> 
When I went into my degree in phsyics, 
I personally didn't need a Malaysian physicist to tell me I could do physics. 
I am aware there are little opportunities in Malaysia, and that a physics career 
may be better spent abroad. 
</p> 

<p> 
If I did have to point to someone, it has to be Professor Wan Ahmad Tajuddin. 
Back then, when I joined his group when I was an undergrad, they only had one experiment. 
That's when I realised doing particle physics was not impossible, you just have to persist. 
It might be slow, but you can do it. 
That gave me more confidence that I could get involved in this kind of stuff.
