<h2>The classical view of an oscillator</h2> 
<p> 
The classical Hamiltonian for a simple harmonic oscillator 
is given by 

\[ H = \frac{1}{ 2} \frac{ p ^ 2 } { m } + \frac{ 1 } { 2} m \omega ^ 2 x ^ 2 \] 
This is typically broken down into 
creation and annihilation operators 

\[ a = \sqrt{ \frac{ m \omega} { 2 } } \left( x + \frac{ i p }{ m \omega} \right), 
\quad a ^ \dagger = \sqrt{ \frac{ m \omega } { 2 } } \left( x - \frac{ i p }{ m \omega} \right) \] 

Imposing the canonical commutation relations imply that
these operators have the commutation relations 

\[ [ a , a^\dagger ]  =1 \] 

For a single mode, we find that 
the Hamiltonian in the single mode oscillator case 
is given by 

\[ H = \omega ( a ^ \dagegr a + \frac{ 1 } { 2} ) \] 

This is what guides is for the form of the Hamiltonian 
in quantum field theory.

<h2>Some Hamiltonians in Quantum Field Theory</h2> 

<p> 
In Schwartz, the free field Hamiltonian for a scalar field 
theory is given by 

\[ H = \int \frac{ d ^ 3 p }{ ( 2 \pi ) ^ 3 } \omega_ p \left( a _ p ^ \dagger a _ p + \frac{ 1 } {  2} \right) \] 

In a massless theory, we have that \( \omega_p = | \mathbf { p } | \). 
</p>

<p>
We can alternatively do this straight from 
quantum field theory. In terms of the commutation relations 
on the position dependent operators, we have that our position and 
mommentum operators satisfy 

\[ [ \phi ( \mathbf x ), \pi ( \mathbf y ) ] = i \delta ( \mathbf x - \mathbf y ), \quad [ a _ {\mathbf p } , a _ { \mathbf { q }} ] = ( 2 \pi) ^ 3 \delta ( 
\mathbf{ p }  - \mathbf q ) \] 

The resulting Hamiltonian looks like 
\[ H = \frac{ 1} { 2 } \int d ^ 3 x \pi ^ 2 + ( \nabla \phi ) ^ 2 + m ^ 2 \phi ^ 2  = \int \frac{ 
d ^ 3 p } { ( 2 \pi) ^ 3 } \omega _ p \left[ a _ p ^ \dagger a _ p + \frac{ 1 } { 2 } ( 2 \pi ) ^ 3 \delta ( 0) \right] \] 

The Hamiltonian differs from the one above 
because we have more carefully input  
a delta function term. 
We can seperate out the funny contribution by 
writing out the delta function explicitly 
in a finite volume box. 
</p> 

<p> 
Hence, we can write out the full Hamiltonian 
for a massless scalar field theory as 
\[ H = \int \frac{ d ^ 3 p } { ( 2\pi ) ^ 3 } \omega_ p \left[ a ^ \dagger _ p a _ p \right] + V E_ 0 \] 

Where in this case \( E _ 0 \) is the integral over all frequencies. 
</p> 

<h2> The Fermionic case </h2> 
<p> 
In the case where we have Fermions, 
our Lagrangian is given by the Dirac equation 
\[ L = \bar{ \psi} ( i \gamma ^ \mu \partial _\mu  - m ) \psi \] 
Constructing the Hamiltonian from 
the stress energy tensor, we find that 

\[ E  = \sum _ s \int \frac{ d ^ 3 q } { ( 2 \pi ) ^ 3 } \omega_p 
( a _ p ^ \dagger a _ p  - b _ p b _ p ^ \dagger ) \] 
Now, note that in this case 
we require anticommutation relations to prevent a negative unbounded energy 
situation occuring. 
The computation is the same as above but this time our energy 
takes the form 

\[ E  =\sum _ s \left[ \int \frac{ d ^ 3 q } { ( 2 \pi ) ^ 3 } 
\omega_ p ( a _ p ^ \dagger a _ p - b _ p ^ \dagger b _ p )  - V E _ 0 \right] \] 

Hence, in this case, the fermionic energy has opposite sign!
