<h3> What is a quadratic program? </h3> 

<p> 
A quadratic program is an optimisation problem of the
form 

\[ 
\begin{aligned} 
	\text{minimize} & ( 1/ 2 ) x ^ T P x + q ^ T x \\
	\text{subject to } & l \leq A x \leq u \\
\end{aligned} 
\] 

In other words, we have a quantity for which we 
want to minimise, subject to a linear set of constraints. 
In this case, the decision variable \( x \) will be 
of a given size \( n \in \mathbb { N } \), and we will have 
some \( m \in \mathbb{ N } \) constraints, along with 
\( N \) non-zero entries in the matrices \( P , A \). 
The tuple 
\( (N , n, m ) \) is typically a way to parametrise the 'size' of 
the problem we want to solve. 
</p> 

<h3> What is an interior point method? </h3> 
<p> 
Interior point methods model the constraints in an optimisation 
function as 'barriers', by pushing them up into the objection function, 
finding the minimum point of this new surface, then making these barriers steep as possible. 
</p> 

<p> 
Let's look at the one dimensional case for now. For example, if we have some function 
\( f ( x ) \) which we want to minimse subject to a single constraint 
\[ c ( x )  \geq 0  \] 
we could penalise the optimisation for going above the constraint 
by attaching a logarithmic function in the objective which
pitches up if \( c ( x) \) approaches zero. 
So, we could instead choose to maximise 
\[  B ( x , \mu )  = f ( x ) - \mu \log ( c ( x) ) \] 
And take the limit as \( \mu \to 0 \). 

</p>

<p> 
To do this, we do the following procedure. 
We rewrite the problem as 
\[ 
\begin{aligned} 
\text{min } & t f ( x ) + \phi (x ) \\
\text{subject to } & A x = b 
\end{aligned} 
\] 

We construct a path of initial points as we take the limit of \( t \) 
to be sufficiently large. 
To do this, we start with some intial value \( t = t _ 0 > \), 
and then use Newton's method to get the solution \( x ^ 0 = x ^ * ( t ) \)
to the above problem. 
We then use this new optimal value a the inital starting point 
for the problem with \( t \to \lambda t \), where \( \lambda > 1 \), 
and keep going until \( t \) is sufficiently large. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Interior point methods are currently the defacto algorithm 
used in most commercial solvers.

<h3> Optimality conditions</h3> 
<p> 
We can rewrite the 
constrained problem in terms of Lagrangian 
multipliers, using a dual variable. 
As usual with the Lagrangian approach,
we will introduce \( y ) 
which encodes the constraint as 

\[ L ( x , y ) =  \( \frac{ 1 } { 2} x ^ T P x + q ^ T x + ( A x  - z ) ^ T y \] 

where we have the additional constraint \( A x =z \). 
For the optimal point, we differentiate 
both for \( x, y \) to yield the optimality condition that 
Differentiating the above conditions 

\[ \begin{aligned} 
Ax  &= z \\
P x + q + A^ T y & = 0 
\end{aligned} 
\] 
<h3> Advantages of the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers routine </h3> 
<p>  
The alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) routine 
has been popular lately due to its good convergence 
propertires. It also is known to 
provide decent accuracy quite cheaply. 
However it is typically unable to detect unfeasibility in a problem, and it 
is currently also unclear how to select optimal step size parameters to 
get an optimal convergence rate. 
</p>
<h3> Solution using the alternating method of multipliers </h3> 
<p> 
With the ADMM method, we take a slightly different approach. 
In the above scenario, \( x \in \mathbb{ R } ^ n \) is our control variable, 
and \( z \in \mathbb{ R } ^ m \) encodes our constraints. 
We reformat the problem by imposing a new constraint that 
two auxillary variables \( \bar{ x}, \bar{z } \) are equal to 
\( x, z \) respectively, and push the constraint \( A x  = z \) 
into the objective function with an indicator function. 
</p> 

<p> 
The first step of the ADMM algorithm states that 
we have to solve the problem 

\[ begin{aligned} 
\text{minimise }  &  (1 / 2) \bar {x } ^ T P \bar {x } + q ^T \bar { x } + ( \sigma / 2 ) 
| \bar { x }  - x ^ k | ^ 2 + ( \rho / 2 ) | \bar { z }  - z ^ k + \rho ^ { - 1} y ^ k | ^ 2  \\ 
\text{subject to } & A \bar { x }  = \bar { z } \\
 \end{aligned} 
\]
