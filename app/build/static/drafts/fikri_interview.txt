Questions to ask 

- Could you give me a brief overview of your background and how you ended up as the Director of the NCPP?

- Could you outline the main projects Malaysia is contributing to in terms of particle physics?

- Go into details of some problems and what do we expect. Specifically, what projects are Malaysians contributing. 

- What are the NCPP's main research goals for the coming year?

- In terms of STEM subjects, Malaysia seems to have a cultural push towards fields like engineering. What made you go against the grain and pursue physics instead?

- Do you think Malaysians would be supportive in trying to build a particle collider here?

- What field of expertise do you think Malaysians can contribute the most?

- What are some of the key challenges that Malaysia faces in terms of developing our understanding of fundamental science? Building on from that, do you think fundamental physics research should be a priority for the Malaysian government?

- What has been the biggest disappointment so far in terms of particle physics research in recent years? Could you tell us a bit more about supersymmetry?
