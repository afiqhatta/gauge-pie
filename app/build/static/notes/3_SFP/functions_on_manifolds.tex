\subsection{Functions on manifolds} 
On this manifold, we can define objects like curves and scalar functions.  A function on a manifold is like a 'heatmap', 
\[
	f : \mathcal{M} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}. 
\]
This map $f$ can be smooth or not, of course. How do we define concepts like differentiability and continuity on functions on a manifold? Well, since the space is homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^n$, we can say a function $f : \mathcal{M} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is differentiable provided that that its corresponding function $f' : \mathcal{U} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ is differentiable, where $U$ is the image of the homeomorphism from $\mathcal{M} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$. 

Similarly, we can define curves on this manifold. Think of a path an ant takes on this curved space. A curve $\lambda$ is precisely this kind of path. This is a smooth map from an interval $I$, which without loss of generality we set $I = (0, 1)$, to the manifold. 
\[ 
	\lambda : I \rightarrow \mathcal{M}. 
\]
