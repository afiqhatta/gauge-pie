\subsection{Tangent vectors}
If we compose a curve with a function on a manifold, we get a function from $I \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$. This of this composition as taking a 'slice' of the function along the manifold. What interests us is that we can then take the derivative at $x = 0$ along this curve. 
Think of 
\[
	\frac{d f (\lambda (t))}{dt}\mid_{t = 0}, 
\]
which makes sense since $f \circ \lambda : I \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$. So, we're not doing anything suspicious here. 
This action of taking a function on a manifold and then differentiating it is interesting. With every curve, we can associate a differential operator which corresponds to differentiating a function on that curve.
