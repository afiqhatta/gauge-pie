General relativity is a theory of gravity. 
It's a system based on geometry that says gravity comes from dips and warps in spacetime. 
General relativity helps us predict a range of 
previously unexplained phenomena, like the funky orbits of mercury, light that bends, time dilation 
and more. 
It was developed by Albert Einstein in the beginning of the 20th Century.
