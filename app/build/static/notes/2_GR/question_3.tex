\subsection{Question 3} 
In this question, we show that only symmetric (antisymmetric) parts of a tensor are 'conserved' whe contracted with symmetric (antisymmetric) tensors over the same indices. If $S^{ \mu \nu} $ is symmetric, then 
\begin{align*} 
V^{ ( \mu \nu) } S_{\mu \nu}  & = \frac{1}{2} \left( V^{ \mu \nu} + V^{ \nu \mu} \right)S_{ \mu \nu} \\
&= \frac{1}{2} V^{\mu \nu}S_{ \mu \nu} + \frac{1}{2} V^{ \nu \mu} S_{\mu \nu} \\
&= \frac{1}{2} V^{\mu \nu}S_{ \mu \nu} + \frac{1}{2} V^{\nu \mu}S_{ \nu \mu } \\
&= \frac{1}{ 2} V^{\mu_\nu} S_{ \mu \nu} + \frac{1}{2} V^{\mu \nu}S_{ \mu \nu} \\
&= V^{ \mu \nu} S_{ \mu \nu} 
\end{align*} 
Going into the second last line we've just relabelled over summed indices. Going into the third line we've used the fact that $S$ is a symmetric tensor.The case for when we contract $V^{\mu \nu}$ for an antisymmetric tensor is entirely similar.
