\subsection{Particle indistinguishability and Particle conservation}
In quantum mechanics, when we talk about multiparticle systems, we usually tensor product their state representation like $\ket{\psi} \otimes \ket{\phi}$, and we usually don't care about how these things interact. In quantum mechanics, we view particle number as conserved. When we do this however, and attempt to make Schrodinger's equation relativistic, we run into problems with regards to causality violation and unbounded energy. However, in QFT we have multiparticle states, with creation and annihilation operators which remedy this situation.
