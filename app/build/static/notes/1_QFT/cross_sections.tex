\section{Cross sections and decay rates} 
In this section, we'll look at 
calculating decay rates (the probability of particles 
undertaking a certain type of scattering due to the 
interaction potential). 

\subsubsection{Kinematics} 
Let's first consider the case of 2 particles 
scattering into two particles. For example,
this could be a nucleon anti-nucleon pair scattering 
into two mesons $ ( \overline{ \psi } \psi \to \phi \phi $. 

To analyse this problem from a kinematic perspective, 
we analyse incoming and outgoing momenta. 
Suppose that $ p_1 ^ \mu $ and $ p_2 ^ \mu $ 
represent the 4 momenta of the two incoming 
particles, and that $ q_1 ^ \mu $ and $ q_2 ^ \mu  $
represent their outgoing momenta. 
Due to conservation of momentum, we have that 
\[
 p_1 ^ \mu + p_2 ^ \mu = q_ 1 ^ \mu + q_2 ^ \mu 
\] if we define the Mandelstam variables 
\begin{align*}
	s  & := (p_1 + p_2 ) ^ 2 \\
	t & : = ( p_1 - q_1 ) ^ 2 \\
	u & : = ( p_1 - q_2 ) ^ 2 
\end{align*} 
The neat thing about these variables
is that, when we add them up, we get the sum of 
the squares of the rest masses of our constituent 
particles.
\begin{align*}
	s + t + u &=  3 p_1 ^ 2 + p_2 ^ 2 + q_1 ^ 2 + q_2 ^ 2 
	+ 2 p_1 \cdot  p_2  - 2 p_1 \cdot  q_1 - 2 p_1 \cdot  q_2 \\
		  &=  3 p_1 ^2 + p_2 ^ 2 + q_1 ^ 2 + q_2 ^ 2 + 2 p_1 \cdot  p_2 - 2 p_1 \cdot  ( p_1 + p_2 )  \\
		  &=  3 p_1 ^ 2 + p_2 ^ 2 + q_1 ^ 2 + q_2 ^ 2 - 2 p_1 ^ 2  \\
		  &=  p_1 ^ 2 + p_2 ^ 2 + q_1 ^ 2 + q_2 ^ 2
\end{align*}
However, due to the relativistic dispersion relation, 
we have that $p ^  2 = m ^ 2 $, 
so we have the result that 
\[
	s + t + u = m_1 ^ 2 + m_2 ^ 2 + ( m_1' )  ^ 2 + ( m_2' )  ^ 2
\] We can write out scattering amplitude 
for $ \psi \overline{ \psi } \to \psi \overline{ \psi } $ scattering 
we had earlier in terms of the Mandelstam variables. 
\begin{align*}
	i \mathcal{ M } &=  ( - i g ) ^ 2 \left\{  \frac{1}{ 
	( p_1 - q_1 ) ^2 - m ^ 2 } + \frac{1}{ ( p_1 - q_2) ^ 2 - m^ 2 } \right\}  \\
			&=  ( - i g ) ^ 2 \left\{  \frac{1}{t - m ^ 2 } + \frac{1}{ u - m ^ 2 } \right\}  \\
\end{align*}

\subsubsection{Decay rates} 
Recall that in our earlier section, 
we expressed the probability amplitude of scattering 
as a product of a Dirac delta function which imposed 
the conservation of momentum, and the factor 
$ \mathcal{ M } $ which we called the amplitude
\[
	\bra{ \phi } S- 1 \ket{ i } = i \mathcal{ M } ( 2 \pi ) ^ 4 
	\delta ^ 4 ( p_ i - \sum_i q_i ) 
\] \textbf{Note} that $ p_i $ here is not an 
index, but a label for the total momentum 
of particles in the initial state!

Just to refresh our memory, we 
expressed momentum conservation in terms of 
a delta function which summed initial and final states in 
terms of of definite momenta. Now, we can 
ask ourselves, how do we convert this into a probability 
value that we can measure in experiment? 
Well, we take the modulus of the amplitude, 
and divide by $ \bra{f}\ket{f} \bra{i}\ket{i } $ since
these initial states necessarily already normalised. 
Our probability is given by 
\[
	P = \frac{ \| \bra { f} ( S -  1 ) \ket { i } \| ^ 2 }{
	\bra { f}\ket { f} \bra{ i }\ket{ i } }
\]
From this, we then define our differential cross section, 
which roughly is the incremental change in area we 
get when scattering particles through some interaction 
potential (see Peskin and Schroeder for a proof of 
this result). 
\[
	d \sigma = \frac{ ( 2 \pi ) ^ 4 \delta ^ 4 \left( p_1 + p_2 - \sum_ i q _ i \right) | \mathcal{M } | ^ 2 }{
	\mathcal{ F }}
\] Here, $ \mathcal{ F } $ is our flux factor with 
\[
	\mathcal{ F } = 4 \sqrt{ ( p_1 \cdot  p_2 ) ^ 2 - m_1^ 2 m_2 ^ 2} 
\] To find our total cross section from $ i \to f $, 
we integrate over our final state momentum in the usual 
Lorentz invariant way, that is, over 
integrals in momentum space with the measure $ \int \frac{d ^ 3 p }{ ( 2 \pi ) ^ 3  2 E_{ p}}$. 
Thus, integrating our differential cross 
section over each momentum variable gives us 
 \[
 \sigma = \int \frac{1}{ \mathcal{ F } } d p_{ f } | \mathcal{ M } | ^ 2 
\] Our measure is given by 
\[
	\int d p _{ f } = ( 2 \pi ) ^ 4 \int \left( 
	\prod_{ r = 1 } ^ n \frac{ d^ 3 q_r }{ ( 2 \pi ) ^ 3 2 E_{ q _r } }\right) 
	\delta ^ 4 \left( p _ i - \sum_ i q_i \right) 
\]
Hence, in the case of $ 2 \to 2 $  scattering for example, 
we set here that $ n = 2 $, so we only have two integrals. 
\subsubsection{$ 2 \to 2 $ scattering}
We will now present an instructive 
example to illustrate calculating 
decay rates. Our aim for this section will be to 
calculate the change in the cross section with respect to 
the Mandelstam variable $ t $. 
We write out this variable as 
\[
	t =  ( p_1 - q_1) ^ 2 = m_1 ^ 2 + m_2 ^ 2 - 2 E_{ p _ 1 } E _{ q _ 1 } + 2 
	\vec{p} _ 1 \cdot  \vec{q} _ 1 
\] We have that 
\[
\frac{ d t }{ d \cos \theta } = 2 | \vec{p} _ 1 | | \vec{q} _ 1 | 
\] where  $ \cos \theta $ is the angle between $ \vec{q}  _ 1 $ and $ \vec{p} _ 1 $. 
It's convinient for us to work in the center of mass frame, 
the frame where our total momenum is $ 0 $. 
Our second Mandelstam variable is 
$ s= ( p_1 + p_2 ) ^ 2 $, which we can work out to be the centre 
of mass energy. This quantity is a constant of the scattering. 
In the first section, we showed that our Lorentz invariant measure 
could be written in terms of Lorentz invariant delta functions. 
For our purposes, we will return to that formalism for $ q_2  $ 
to aid computations. We set 
\[
	\frac{ d ^ 3 q_2 }{ 2 E _{ q_ 2 } } = d ^ 4 q _ 2 \delta ( q_2 ^ 2 - ( m_2 ') ^ 2 ) \theta ( q_2 ^ 0 ) 
\] where we've defined $ \theta $ as the Heaviside step function. 
For the other measure $ d ^ 3 q_1 $, we rewrite 
the measure in terms of polar coordinates. 
\[
	\frac{ d ^ 3 q_1 }{ 2 E _{ q_1 } } = \frac{ | \vec{q} _ 1 | ^ 2 d | \vec{q} _1 | d ( \cos \theta ) 
	d \phi }{ 2 E_{ q_{1 } }} = \frac{1}{ 4 | \vec{p} _ 1 | } d E_{ q_ 1 } d \phi dt 
\] With this in mind, we can write out 
the full Now, putting this together, 
we have an expression 
\[
 \frac{ d \sigma }{ dt } = \frac{1}{8 \phi \mathcal{ F } | \vec{p}_ 1  | } 
 \int d E_{ q_ 1 } | \mathcal{ M } | ^ 2 \delta ( s - m_2 ^ 2  -  ( m_1')  ^ 2 - 2 \vec{q} _ 1 
 \cdot  ( \vec{p} _ 1 + \vec{p} _ 2 ) ) 
\] Now, if we boost back to the centre of mass fram, we have that 
\begin{align*}
	p_1 ^\mu & = ( \sqrt{| \vec{p} _ 1 | ^  2 - m_1 ^ 2 }, \vec{p} _ 1 )  \\
	p_2 ^ \mu &=  ( \sqrt{ | \vec{p} _ 1 | ^ 2 + m_2 ^ 2 }, - \vec{p} _ 1 )   \\
\end{align*}
This means we compute th $ s $ mandelstam variable 
\[
	s = ( \sqrt{ | \vec{p} _1 | ^ 2 + m_1 ^ 2  } + \sqrt{ | \vec{p} _ 2 |^ 2 + m_2 ^ 2  } ) ^ 2  
\] This implies that we can rewrite 
\[
	| \vec{p} _ 1 | = \lambda ^{ \frac{1}{2 } } ( S, m_1 ^ 2 , m_2 ^ 2 ) / 2 \sqrt{ s }  
\] where we have defined 
\[
 \lambda ( x, y , z ) = x^ 2 + y ^ 2 + z ^ 2 - 2xy - 2xz - 2yz
\] From this, we have that 
\[
	\mathcal{ F } = 2 \sqrt{ \lambda ( s , m_1 ^ 2 , m_2 ^ 2 ) } \implies 
	\frac{ d \sigma }{ d t } = \frac{ | \mathcal{ M } | ^ 2 }{ 16 \pi \lambda ( s , m_1 ^ 2 , m_2 ^ 2 ) }
\] 
\subsubsection{Decay rates} 
We defime a partial decay rate for $ \ket{ i } \to \ket{ f } $, 
or partial width, as 
\[
\Gamma _f = \frac{1}{ 2 E_ p } \int d p _ f | \mathcal{ M } | ^ 2  
\] Note that this is not a Lorentz invariant 
quantity due to time dilation. 
Hence, our convention is to quote this in terms 
of the res frame of the initial particle, 
where the energy $E _{ p _ i } $ is equal to 
the mass $ m _ i $. 
We define the total decay with whcih we write as  $ \Gamma $. 
This is the sum of all possible states 
 \[
\Gamma = \sum _ f  \Gamma _ f  
\]
The branching ratio for $\ket{ i } \to \ket { f} $ is denoted as 
\[
 BR ( i \to f )  = \frac{\Gamma_ f }{ \Gamma}
\] If we look at the units, we notice that the average 
lifetime is 
\[
	\tau = 6.6 \times 10 ^{ - 25 } \times ( 1 \text{GeV } ) / \Gamma \text{ seconds }
\]
