\subsection{Scaling in QFT} 
Throughout QFT, we scale out the natural constants $c, \hbar$ to have $c = \hbar = 1$. Because of this, we can form relationship between units of time, length and mass. $c$ is a unit of speed, but since this is set to 1 we have that 
\[ 
[ L ][T]^{-1}  = 1 \implies [L]  = [T] 
\] 
So we have that in this regime, which we call 'natural units' length has units of time. In immediate consequence of this is that energy has the units of mass. 
\[ 
[ E]  = [M] [L]^2 [T]^{-2} = [M] 
\] 
Our condition that the Planck constant goes to 1 implies that \[ 
[ M ][ L]^2 [ T]^{ -1}  = 1 \implies [M ]  = [ L]^{ -1} 
\]
