\subsection{Problems with QFT} 
In these notes, we'll have a 'free theory' where particles don't interact, and we solve for states analytically. Later, we'll also add on 'interaction terms', where particles do interact and we have to resort to perturbation techniques to study physical quantities of interest. Within these notes, we assume that these interaction terms are small. Physics where we try to understand how to deal with larger interactions is still a big area of research (see lattice QCD where we try to discretise space time and solve QFT numerically).
