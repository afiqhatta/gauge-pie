Quantum field theory is humanity's most successful attempt 
(so far) to combine quantum mechanics with Einstein's theory of special relativity. 
It solves a host of problems in quantum mechanics such as the issues of causality and
action at a distance. 
In quantum field theory, we don't treat particles as solid objects, but instead as 
excitations of an oscillator.
