\subsection{Scattering revisited} 
Now, to order $ O ( g ^ 2)  $From our first diagram, we have that our contribution is 
given by the sum of the diagrams in figure \ref{fig:figures/feyn_3}. Applying our 
Feynman rules, we have that these diagrams give an integral
of 
\begin{align*}
=( - i g ) ^ 2 \int \frac{ d^ 4 k }{ ( 2 \pi ) ^ 4 } \frac{ i }{ k ^ 2 - m ^ 2 + i \epsilon } &  ( 2 \pi ) ^ 8 ( \delta ( p_1 - p_1 ' - k ) \delta ( p_2 + k - p_2 ' ) \\
										      & + \delta ( p_1 - p_2' - k ) \delta ( p_2 + k - p_1 ' ) ) 	
\end{align*}

Our final scattering momenta to second order 
is therefore 
\[
i (  - i g ) ^ 2 \left\{  \frac{1}{ ( p_1 - p_1 ' ) ^ 2 - m ^ 2 + i \epsilon  } + \frac{1}{ ( p_1 - p_2 ' ) ^ 2 - m ^ 2 + i \epsilon }  \right\} ( 2 \pi ) ^ 4 \delta ( p_1 + p_2 - p_1' - p_2' )  
\] Note that the meson doesn't necessarily satisfy the relation 
that $ k ^ 2 = m ^ 2 $. 
If its doesn't it's called an off shell or virtual particle. 
One might also think that the second diagram in figure 
\ref{fig:figures/feyn_3} is superfluous, but 
we need to count this as a distinct diagram since 
the $ \psi $ are indistinguishable 
under exchange, and hence obey Bose-Einstein statistics
for identical particles.

We can go to even higher order to the point where we 
introduce loops into our diagrams.
