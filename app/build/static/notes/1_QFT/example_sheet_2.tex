\section{Example Sheet 2} 

In general, save ink by writing exponents 
with either $ e ^{ i x \cdot  ( p - q ) } $ together, 
or either $ e ^{ i x \cdot  ( p + q ) } $ together.

Save ink by not bothering to write the whole measure, 
and writing out just the operators we're concerned with. 
We can write out. 

\subsection{Question 1} 
Our stress energy tensor for $ \mu  = 1, 2, 3 $
is given by $ T^{  0 \mu }  = \partial  ^ \mu \phi \dot{ \phi }  = \eta^{ \mu \nu  }$. 

We can write out time evolution 
for $ a_{ p } $ explicitly 
by using the Heisenberg equation
of motion 
\[
	\frac{ d a_{ p } }{  dt }  = i [ H , a_ p ] = i E_ p a_ p 
\]

\subsection{Question 4} 
Notes on this question. 

We need to use the energy momentum tensor expansion. 
Tske the derivatives out. 

Write out $ x ^ j  $ by differentiating in the 
very beginning, then only differentiate by parts after that. 

Use liberally the argument involving odd and even. 


\subsection{Question 7} 

Be careful with counting! Especially with the double 8 diagram.  
In this question, we wish to verify the bubble diagram expansion for 
$ \phi ^ 4 $ theory, for vacuum to vacuum scattering. 
Specifically, we're interested 
in the expansion to $ \lambda ^ 2 $ order for 
$ \bra{ 0 } S \ket{ 0 } $, where, due to Dyson's formula, 
we have that 
\[
	S = 1 - \frac{i \lambda }{ 4 ! } \int_{ - \infty } ^ \infty dt H_ I ( x) 
	+ \frac{1}{2 } \frac{\lambda ^ 2 }{ (4 ! ) ^ 2  } \int_{ - \infty } ^ \infty 
	 dt_ 1 \int_{ - \infty} ^ \infty dt _ 2 \mathcal{ T } \left\{  
	 H _I (t_1, \vec{x} ) H _ I (t_2, \vec{x}) \right\} 
\] Writing this in terms 
of our Hamiltonian density instead, we have that this simplifies 
down to 
\[
	S = 1 - \frac{i \lambda }{  4 ! } \int d ^ 4 x \, \mathcal{ H } _ I ( x ) 
	+ \frac{1}{2 } \frac{\lambda ^ 2 }{ ( 4 ! ) ^ 2 } \int d^ 4 x_ 1  d^ 4 x_ 2 
	\mathcal{ T } \left\{  \mathcal{ H } _ I ( x _ 1 ) H _ I ( x _ 2 )  \right\} 
\] where we have our interaction picture Hamiltonian given 
by $ \mathcal{ H } _ I ( x) = \phi _ I ^4  ( x) $. 
Now,let's look at the contribution 
to the first order in $ \lambda $. This contribution 
is given by 
\[
  \frac{ - i \lambda }{ 4 ! } \int d ^ 4 x \,  \bra{ 0 } 
  \mathcal{ T  } \left\{  \phi ( x) \phi ( x) \phi ( x) \phi ( x)  \right\} \ket{ 0 } 
\] Now, due to Wick's theorem, the integrand 
can be expanded out in terms of all possible contractions 
of the two fields. There are $3$ ways to do this. 
This is because we could've 
contracted the first field with $ 3$ others, 
which leaves the last two fields to contract 
on their own. This means
that our total contribution from first order from this field 
is 
\[
	- \frac{ i \lambda }{ 8 } \int d^ 4 x \, D ( x - x ) D ( x -x) 
\] This is represented by a figure $ 8 $ diagram. 
Now, we aim to show that this matches up with the 
diagram shown in the exponential. 
To first order in $ \lambda $, our 
exponential is given by 
\begin{equation*}
	\feynmandiagram[small]{ 
		a [particle = \( x \) ]  -- [ghost, half left] c 
		-- [ghost, half left] a 
		-- [ghost, half left] b 
		-- [ghost, half left] a, 
	}; 
\end{equation*}
We know that from this diagram 
that, by assigning propagators to each line, that 
this is proportional to $ \int d ^ 4 x \, D ( x- x ) D ( x - x) $. 
But, what about the symmetry factors? This diagram 
has a symmetry factor of $ 8 $ since we assign a factor 
of two for being able to switch the ends of the bottom and top loops. 
In addition, we assign another factor of $2 $ since we 
can rotate the diagram $ 180 $ degrees.

Now, looking to second order in $ \lambda ^ 2 $, we'd
like to find the amplitude given by the expression 
\[
	\frac{\lambda ^ 2 }{2 ( 4 ! ) ^ 2 }
	\int d ^ 4 x \, d ^ y \mathcal{ T } \left\{  \phi_x \phi _ x \phi_ x \phi_ x \phi _ y \phi _ y \phi _ y \phi _ y  \right\} 
\] Let's examine the possible contractions that we get from this. 
We could have that the $ \phi _ x $ and $ \phi _ y $ terms are 
contracted internally amongst themselves. There are $3 $ ways 
to contract the $ \phi _ x $ amongst themselves and $ 3 $ ways to 
contract the $ \phi _ y $ amongst themselves, so we have $ 9 $ ways in total. 
This means that our contribution is given by 
\[
	\frac{1}{2 } \frac{\lambda ^2 }{ 8 ^ 2 } \int d ^ 4 x d ^ 4 y D ( x - x)  D( x - x ) D ( y - y ) D ( y - y) 
\] The factor of $ \frac{1}{2 } $ comes from Dyson's formula. 
As a diagram, this is represented by the diagram 
\begin{equation*}
	\feynmandiagram[small]{ 
		a [particle = \( x \) ]  -- [scalar, half left] c 
		-- [scalar, half left] a 
		-- [scalar, half left] b 
		-- [scalar, half left] a, 
		}; 
	\feynmandiagram[small]{ 
		a [particle = \( y \) ]  -- [scalar, half left] c 
		-- [scalar, half left] a 
		-- [scalar, half left] b 
		-- [scalar, half left] a, 
		};
\end{equation*}
Our symmetry factor for this diagram is $ 2 \times 8 ^ 2 $, since, 
as we discussed before, we have a symmetry of 8 for each diagram. 
In addition, we could've swapped the diagrams as well. 
This agrees with the above. 

The next thing to do is that we could have contracted 
each of the $ \phi_ x  $  terms with $ \phi _ y $. Since 
we have four choices to contract the first  $ \phi _ x $
with, then 3, then 2, we have that our contribution 
to this term is \begin{align*} 
	\frac{\lambda ^ 2 4 ! }{ 2 ( 4 ! ) ^ 2 } &  \int d^ 4 x \, d ^ 4 y\, 
	D ( x - y ) D ( x - y ) D ( x - y ) D ( x - y )  = \\ & 
	\frac{ \lambda ^ 2 }{  2 ( 4 ! ) }  \int d^ 4 x \, d ^ 4 y\, 
	D ( x - y ) D ( x - y ) D ( x - y ) D ( x - y ) 
\end{align*} This corresponds to the diagram 
\begin{equation*}
	\feynmandiagram[small]{ 
		a [particle  = \( x \) ] -- [scalar, half left, looseness = 1.5] b [particle = \( y \) ], 
		a -- [scalar, half right, looseness = 1.5] b, 
		a -- [scalar] b, 
		a -- [scalar] b, 
	}; 
\end{equation*}

Finally, our last possible type of contraction is 
what happens when we contract just two of the $ \phi _ x $ 
fields with two of the $ \phi _ y $ fields, 
and loop the rest. 
There are $ \begin{pmatrix}  4 \\ 2  \end{pmatrix}   = 6 $ ways 
to choose which to $ \phi _ x $ fields we contract with $ \phi _ y $, 
and once we chose the $ \phi _ x $ fields, we have $ 12  = 4 \times 3 $ 
options to which we can contract them. This means that 
the contribution gained from this is 
\begin{align*} 
	- \frac{ \lambda ^ 2 6 \times 4 \times 3}{2 ( 4 ! ) ^ 2  } & 
	\int d ^ 4 x \,    d ^ 4 y D ( x - x ) D ( y -x ) D ( y - x ) D ( y - y )  
	=   \\  & - \frac{\lambda ^ 2 }{16  }	\int d ^ 4 x \,    d ^ 4 y D ( x - x ) D ( y -x ) D ( y - x ) D ( y - y )  
\end{align*} This is associated with the 
diagram 
\begin{equation*}
	\feynmandiagram[small]{ 
	a -- [scalar, half left] b [particle = \( x\) ] -- [scalar, half left] a , 
	b -- [scalar, half left] c [particle = \( y \) ] -- [scalar, half left] b, 
	c -- [scalar, half left] d -- [scalar, half left] c, 
}; 
\end{equation*}

We can switch around the two loops as well as the two propagators in the centre.
Hence, we've showed that to second order in $ \lambda$, 
the combinatoric and symmetry factors work 
out for each diagram when we exponentiate the bubble 
diagrams.

\subsection{Question 8} 
For the Yukawa term, we need only attach 
$ i g $ to each vertex. 
We need to take into account combinatoric factors for 
each vertex if the 
same time of propagator is going into them. 



To find the mass dimensions of $ g, h, k, l $, we 
need to first find the mass dimensions of the fields $ \phi $ and $ \psi $. 
Our scalar action needs to be dimensionless, so 
 \[
 \int d ^ 4 x \, \frac{1}{2 } \partial  _ \mu \phi \partial  ^ \mu \phi 
\] has mass dimension $ 0 $. This implies that $ [ \phi ] = 1 $. 
Similarly, we find that  $ [ \psi ] = 1 $. 
This means that the mass dimensions of $ g, k$ are  $ [ g ] = [ k]  = 1$. 
We have that $[ h ] = 0 $, and $ [ l ] = - 1$. 
This theory contains both relevant, marginal and irrelevant operators.
Thus, the theory is non-renormalisable since the $ l $ dimension 
is irrelevant.

We have four interaction terms, 
which means that we get 4 distinct types 
of diagrams, each with their own set of Feynman rules. 
Let's tackle the Yukawa interaction first. 
We know the momentum rules for this. 
Now, for the interaction $ h | \psi | ^ 4  = h \psi \psi ^ * \psi \psi ^ * $, 
we have that our interaction vertex is given by 
 \begin{equation*}
	 \feynmandiagram[small]{ 
		 a -- [fermion] b, 
		 c -- [fermion] b, 
		 b -- [fermion] d, 
		 b -- [fermion] e
		}; 
\end{equation*}
Now, with this kind of diagram, our propagator 
comes from contracting just $ \psi , \psi ^ *$ together, 
which gives us a propagator in momentum space which looks 
like 
 \[
 \frac{i}{p ^ 2 - \mu ^ 2 + i \epsilon } 
\]
For the term $ k \phi ^ 3 $, we have that our vertices 
look like 
\begin{equation*}
	\feynmandiagram[small]{ 
		 a -- [scalar] b, 
 		 c -- [scalar] b, 
 		 d -- [scalar] b, 

	}; 
\end{equation*}
We need to also add in combinatoric factors, so we attach a 6 to this. 
Each of these objects come with a propagator which comes from 
contracting two scalars together 
\[
 \frac{i }{ p ^ 2 - m ^ 2 + i \epsilon }
\] 
Finally, the non-trivial one is the propagator that comes 
from interactions with $ \phi \partial  _ \mu \psi \partial  ^ \mu \psi ^ *  $. 
In this case, we have a different kind of propagator! 
Non-zero contributions come from contractions of the form 
\[
 \wick{ \c \phi \c \phi  \c \psi ^ * \partial _ \mu \c \psi 
 \c \partial  ^ \mu \c \psi ^ * \c \psi }
\] Differentiating the contraction of $ \psi $ and $ \psi ^ * $
pulls out a factor of  $ i \pi ^ \mu $. Thus, since 
we'll always have an even number of propagators involving the anti-nucleons, 
for each pair we attach a factor of 
 \[
  \frac{ - p \cdot  q  }{ p ^ 2-m ^ 2 + i \epsilon }
\] 

\pagebreak 
\subsection{Question 9} 
We want to find the decay width 
for the scattering process $ \phi \to \psi \overline{ \psi } $. 
For studying the decay width up to order $ g ^ 2 $, 
we need only consider the trivial Feynman diagram with 
one vertex (since $ \Gamma \sim | \mathcal{ M } | ^ 2 $.  
\begin{equation*}
	\feynmandiagram[small]{
		a -- [scalar] b, 
		c -- [fermion] b -- [fermion] d, 
	}; 
\end{equation*}
Now, since this already imposes momentum conservation, 
our amplitude $\mathcal{ M } $ is just $  i g  $.
Thus, our decay width is given by the formula 
\[
	\Gamma = \frac{1}{2m } g ^ 2 \frac{1}{( 2 \pi ) ^ 2}  \int 
	\frac{d ^ 3 q_1  d ^ 3 q_2 }{ 2 E _{ q_1 } 2 E _{ q_2 } } \delta ^ 4 ( p_1- q_1 - q_2) 
\] The trick here is to 
rewrite the invariant measure $ \frac{ d ^ 3 q_2 }{ ( 2 E_{ q_2 } }$ as $  \delta^ 4 \left(  
( q_2 ^ 2 - \mu ^ 2 \right)  $ (notice we're using $ \mu ^ 2 $ since this 
comes from the nucleon. 
Substituting this in, then integrating over $ q_2 $, 
we get that our decay width is 
\[
	\Gamma = \frac{g ^ 2 }{ ( 2 \pi ) ^ 2 2m } \int \frac{d ^ 3 q_1 }{ 2 E_{ q_1 } } \delta ^  4
	\left(  ( p_1 - q_1 ) ^ 2  - \mu ^ 2  \right) 
\] Now, we'd like to find the set of $ q_1 $ such that $ ( p_1 - q_1 ) ^ 2  = \mu ^ 2 $. 
Our relativistic dispersion relation gives us that $ p_1 ^ 2 = m ^ 2 $, 
and $q_1 ^ 2 = \mu ^ 2 $. Also, in the convention of calculating 
decay widths, we work in the rest frame of the incoming particle (in this case, 
the meson). This means that we take $ p_1 = ( m , 0 ) $. 
\begin{align*}
	p_1 ^ 2 + q_1 ^ 2 - 2 p_1 \cdot  q_1  &=  \mu ^ 2 \\
	m ^ 2 + \mu ^ 2  - 2 m E_{ q_1 }  &= \mu ^ 2 \\
	m ^ 2  - 2m \sqrt{ \mu ^ 2 + \vec{q} _ 1 ^ 2 } &=  0  \\
	\| \vec{q} _ 1 \|  & = \pm \sqrt{ \frac{m ^ 2 }{ 4 }  - \mu ^ 2 } 
\end{align*}
Our decay width is the integral 
\[
	\Gamma = \frac{g ^ 2 }{ 16 \pi ^ 2 m } \int \frac{d ^ 3 q_1 }{ E_{ q_1 } } \delta ^ 4 \left(  
	m ^ 2- 2m \sqrt{ \mu ^ 2 + \| \vec{q} _ 1 \| ^ 2 } \right) 
\] Selecting the positive root in the delta function, using 
our standard identity for a delta function of a function, this 
gives that the integral is 
\begin{align*} 
	\Gamma & = \frac{g ^ 2 }{ 16 \pi ^ 2 m } \int \frac{d ^ 3 q_1 }{ E_{ q_1 } } 
	\frac{\delta \left(  | \vec{q} _ 1 |   - | \vec{q} _ 1 ^ * |   \right) }{
	 \frac{2m | \vec{q} _ 1 ^ * | }{ \sqrt{ \mu ^ 2 + |\vec{q} _ 1 ^ *  | ^ 2 }  }} \\
	 &=  \frac{ g ^ 2 }{ 16 \pi ^ 2 m } \int d |\vec{q} _ 1 | \frac{ 4 \pi | \vec{q} _ 1 | ^ 2 
	 \delta ( | \vec{q} _ 1 |  - | \vec{q} _ 1 ^ * | ) }{2m E_{ q _ 1  } \frac{| \vec{q} _ 1 ^ * | }{
 \sqrt{ \mu ^ 2 + | \vec{q} _ 1 ^ * | ^ 2 } }} \\
 \end{align*} 
 In the last two lines we converted this integral into spherical 
 coordinates. 
 Integrating out the delta function, this is just 
 \begin{align*} 
	 \Gamma & = \frac{g ^ 2 ( 2 \pi ) }{ 16 \pi ^2 m} \frac{1}{m } \frac{ |\vec{q} _ 1 ^ * | | E_{ q_ 1 ^ * }}{
	 | E_{ q_ 1 ^ * } | } \\ 
	 &=  \frac{ g ^ 2 }{ 8 \pi m ^ 2 } \sqrt{ \frac{m ^ 2 }{ 4 }  - \mu ^ 2 }   \\ 
	 &=  \frac{g ^ 2 }{ 16 \pi m ^ 2 } \left(  1 -\frac{4 \mu ^ 2 }{ m ^ 2 }  \right)^{ \frac{1}{2 } }  \\
	 &=  \frac{g ^ 2 }{ 16 \pi m } \sqrt{ 1 - ( 4 \mu ^ 2 / m ^ 2 ) }  \\
 \end{align*} 
 This has dimensions of mass since $ g  $ has mass dimension $ 1 $, thus 
 decay make sense since this is a rate.
