Our final condition is that this space is complete In quantum mechanics, states are vectors in an infinite dimensional Hilbert space, and the inner product is defined to satisfy the following. The inner product is a map from states in the Hilbert space and its dual, to the complex numbers. \[ \mathcal{H}^* \times \mathcal{H} \rightarrow \mathbb{C} \] The inner product between states $\ket{\psi}, \bra{\phi}$ is denoted $\bra{\phi}\ket{\psi}$, which is a complex number.
