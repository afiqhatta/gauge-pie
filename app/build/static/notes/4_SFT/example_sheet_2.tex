\subsection{Techniques in Statistical Field Theory} 

\subsubsection{Thinking about scaling}
Always explore scaling dimensions! Remember to think 
carefully about how the Jacobian in the measure scales. 

\subsubsection{Terms in our free energy} 
We should always think about terms in our free energy up to scaling. 

\subsection{Wick's Theorem} 
To prove this, just run through the definitions. 
Use symmetry arguments to wash away terms from Wick's theorem. 
Remember to take into account symmetry factors.
