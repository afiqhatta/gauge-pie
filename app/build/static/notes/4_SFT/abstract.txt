Nature exhibits an amazing phenomena called universality, which is the 
principle that seemingly unrelated phase transitions actually exhibit very similar 
behaviour near critical points. The canonical example are the critical exponents in 
magnetism and the phase transition between liquids and gases. This set 
of notes attempts to explain this via the language of the renormalisation group - a method 
which describes how physics changes at different length scales.
