\subsection{Scaling}
Since all scales are washed away in the fixed point, 
we have that our correlation, which is a function of length, 
can only depend on this length scale. So, we must have that 
our correlation function must take the form of a power law. 
\[
	\left< \phi ( \vec{x} ) \phi ( 0 )  \right> = \frac{1}{ r ^{ d - 2 + \eta }}
\] In units of inverse length, we have that 
$ [ x ]  = - 1$,  $ \left[ \frac{\partial }{\partial x }   \right]  = 1 $. 
Since our free energy needs to be dimensionless, 
ie that $ [ F [ \phi ] ]  = 0 $, we have that our dimensions 
of our scalar field satisfies \[
	[ \phi ( \vec{x} ) ] = \frac{d -2  }{ 2 } \implies \eta = 0 
\] Assuming that under the scaling $ \vec{x} \to \frac{\vec{x} }{ \zeta}$, 
that our scalar field $ \phi ( \vec{x} ) \to \zeta ^{ \Delta_{ \phi } } \phi ( \vec{x} ) $, 
substituting this into our power law relation gives that 
\[
 \Delta_\phi = \frac{d -2 + \eta }{ 2 } 
\]  where we have that the $ \frac{d - 2 }{ 2 } $ is referred to 
as our engineering dimension, where are our extraneous factor 
of $ \frac{\eta }{ 2 } $ is referred to as our anomolous dimension. 
There's a difference here. However, we can reconcile this by 
setting 
\[
	\left< \phi ( \vec{x} ) \phi  (0 )  \right>  = \frac{a ^ \mu }{ r ^{ d - 2 + \eta }}
\]
