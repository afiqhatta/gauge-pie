\subsection{Universality} 
A striking experimental observation that we notice with regards to critical exponents is that they seem to match for different systems despite wildly different structures. An example is the critical exponent for the magnetic susceptibility of a material $\chi$ as $T \rightarrow T_c$ and the compressiblity of a gas also as $T \rightarrow T_c$. I'll include more examples later.
