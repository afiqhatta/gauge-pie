Classifying bundles

<p>
A Mobius strip is a fibre bundle with the base space of a 
circle, and interval fibre,  
and  with a structure group \( \mathbb{ Z } _2  \).
since the transition function can be chosen 
to be \( t \mapsto -t \) on one side of the Mobius strip. 

This is the only function which 
seems to be consistent with the transition function 
conditions, due to the invertibility condition. 
</p>


<p> 
Fibre bundles are defined 
by a base space, a structure group, and a projection. 
For example, we can construct a Mobius band by taking a certin base space, \(S^ 1\), 
and then pairing it with a interval as a fibre bundle. As above. 
However, is this the only way to attach fibres onto a circle base space?
It turns out that there is only two ways to do this - which 
can be proven with Cech cohomolgy. 
</p> 
<p> 
The first way to do this would be to just glue 
the two ends, there by making a cylinder and creating a trivial fibre bundle. 
The second way is to flip the transition function negative on the 
lower hemisphere of the circle, 
</p> 

<p> 
A space with a interval fibration is called a line bundle. 
Line bundles have a Cech cohomology with coefficients in \( GL ( \mathbb{ R } , 1 ) \), 
which is equivalent to just, after normalising, linear 
multiplication by either 1 or -1. 
</p> 

<p>
Hence, a cylinder and Mobius strip are 
the only two line bundles over a circle up to isomorphism.
