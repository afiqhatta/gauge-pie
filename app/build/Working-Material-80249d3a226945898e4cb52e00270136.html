<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>This book is a collection of essays that highlight the role of symmetry and asymmetry across a range of academic disciplines. Each essay has been written by an academic that is an expert in their respective fields. One of the aims of this book is to also examine the underlying symmetry between symmetry and asymmetry. Furthermore, we wish to go deeper into the correspondence and interdependence between symmetry and asymmetry. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The topics of order and disorder appear as central themes in a vast range of academic fields. An informed reader would probably guess that these topics might come up in mathematics or physics. However, the themes of order and disorder, and similarly, of symmetry and asymmetry, also occupy a central place in different areas like philosophy, to economics, to music. This book serves not only to provide examples of symmetry and asymmetry in these fields, but also to explore the deep relationship interdependence between symmetry and asymmetry themselves. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Within academic fields, the topics of order and disorder have traditionally been studied separately. Let’s use physics as an example - it is topical since the most recent Nobel prize in physics was awarded to Parisi,   In physics, the word <strong>order</strong> is usually associated with a system that is in a ‘state of low entropy’. Entropy, in this context, to use the words of Gibbs, describes the <em>mixedup-ness</em> of states in a physical system. To understand the concept of entropy, we can do a little thought experiment. Imagine closing your eyes and then flipping a single, fair coin. How many possibilities can can occur when you open them? The coin can occupy two states. However, imagine a system of 10 coins. In this case, we have 2^10 configurations, many more possible states that we could land in. A system with low entropy is a word used to describe a state that has relatively few ways that it could end up. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The word order In aesthetics, the order in philosophy might relate to strucure or proportion. In biology, order might refer to the organised structures in living organisms, like DNA. If we consider the word order in a more relaxed light, we might say that the definition of order might include symmetry. Symmetry, whilst subtly different from the word order, also plays a significant role in these fields. Again the role of symmetry is ubiquituous in physics, symmetries lead to conserved quantities like energy and momentum. In aesthetics, symmetry forms an essential part of beauty. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>On the flip side, the word disorder suggests a state of randomness. Whilst I will fully define what chaos and order mean in the next paragraphs, we are still able to speak about them informally. However, both words elude to the study of complex systems. The word chaos suggests a level of unpredictability. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>In the spirit An online open-access journal was launched at Oxford University in April 2022. ‘<em>Bi-Symmetrics: The Journal of Symmetry &amp; Asymmetry’</em> is edited by Denis Noble and Benedict Rattigan, and it explores the correspondence of opposites in fields as diverse as genetics, physics, mathematics and philosophy.</p>
<h3>The interplay between the two</h3>
<p>Order and disorder at first glance, are disparate fields. These two subjects are often treated separately - whilst there is a wealth of literature on these concepts, we think that there is not much that binds the concepts of order and disorder together. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>However, there is evidence to suggest an underlying correspondence, or mechanism, between symmetry and asymmetry itself. This correspondence is akin to a <em>symmetry of symmetry and asymmetry</em>, rather. The idea of co-dependence between symmetry and asymmetry is by far from new. In line with ancient symbolism in the past, it seems that there is co-dependence between the two that eludes to natures ordering principle. We think there is. There are some explicit examples of this in physics. Symmetry breaking occurs at the transition of when a physical system with a symmetric Lagrangian enters a ground state that is no longer symmetric. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Conserved quantities are by far not the only use of symmetries in modern physics. One surprising concept that I learned as a physics student is the role of symmetry in creating<em> particles themselves. </em>This process is called spontaneous symmetry breaking, and it is currently the best mechanism we have to describe why particles have <strong>mass. </strong>Before I go into detail, I'll explain what happens in short. At low energies, a system might break from a symmetric state into a non-symmetric one. When this happens, we find that weird, ephemeral particles pop into existence, near this low energy state! Whilst this mechanism is used in high energy theoretical physics, it is widely applicable to something as familiar as a magnet.</p>
<p>This book is a collection of articles that highlight the role of symmetry, order, and chaos in different academic fields. Throughout, we will also be expanding on the crucial ideas that invovle the interplay between order and disorder. The precise definition of ‘interplay’ is something that will be made clear, as we review examples from a range of academic fields. We will explore the definitions of order and disorder, and then look at examples of their interdependence.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>What do exactly do we mean by the interplay between order and disorder? How does order arise from disorder? Is disorder a necessary ingredient to achieve an ordered state?  It will examine the profound, although somewhat initially paradoxical ‘symmetry of symmetry and asymmetry’.  </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The interplay between order and chaos has been a central theme of importance in ancient civilisations. Rattigan writes about how the  ancient Egyptians viewed order and chaos as participant in a vast cosmic battle. This was an ancient, ongoing battle between the goddess of order, Ma’at, and the goddess of Chaos Isfet. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>What exactly does symmetry mean?</h3>
<p>The study of symmetry in physics is incredibly well established. Symmetry, in the context of modern physics,  refers to transformations that leaves a system unchanged. A transofrmation might be something as simple   Symmetries that are smooth lead to conserved quantities.  </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The analysis of a physical theory starts with the Lagrangian, which is a system’s kinetic energy subtracted by its potential energy. The construction of a Lagrangian is usually motivated by symmetries, and their shape needs to reflect this in nature. The most apparent set of symmetries a physical theory needs to obey is the Poincaré group. The Poincaré group is, I would say, the most intuitive set of symmetry transformations in <a href="http://nature.IN">nature.</a> Symmetry groups that can be parametrised by smooth shapes also have a crucial role in physics. They are called Lie groups. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Dimitra Rigopolou, in her essay on symmetry on the universe, talks about symmetry and entropy. In particular Rigopolou talks about symmetries in the Standard Model of particle physics.  The Standard Model of particle physics gives rise to the fundamental particles we have currently observed. This model too has symmetries She mentions three that are of note - charge, parity and time reversal. On the flip side, she also describes entropy. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>What does Disorder mean?</h3>
<p>On the flip side, both physics and the social sciences have led a very successful inquiry into the study of chaos and disorder. The definitions of these terms are subtlety different, but for ease of reading the introduction I will put them in the same category. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>(Comes from Giorgio Parisi) Now, what do we mean exactly by 'chaotic' and 'disordered'? Whilst many philosophers are trying to dig into that question, there are a few principles that we can go by. Firstly, how <em>stable</em> is the system? By stable, we mean the sensitivity of a physical system's state to the <strong>initial conditions </strong>that it is placed. Physical systems are governed by a system of equations that we have to solve. But, for the most part, these equations only lead us to a 'general shape' of the solution unless we plug in some data about the initial conditions themselves.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>For example, imagine a pool table on the first hit. As physicists, we'd need to know the initial force and direction of the pool cue to predict the final state. We then ask ourselves if small changes in the initial conditions lead to significant changes in the final outcome. In the case of a pool game, the intuitive answer is yes — had we nudged the first player to miss her initial shot slightly, we could've ended up with a completely different game. In the same vein, if a physical system exhibits a high degree of sensitivity to its initial conditions, we might consider it a complex system.</p>

<p>Alan Barr talks about light and darkness in the context of physics. He talks about neutrinos and their lack of interaction with light. The chapter also discusses dark matter, which is another thing that doesn’t interact with light.

He mentions the LHC for experiments.  </p>

<p><strong>Content from Alan Barr’s Section </strong></p>
<p>These neutrinos exhibit the third kind of darkness. They are dark not because there is no light to strike them, like the darkness of the night. Nor are they dark because they absorb all the light that falls on them, like soot. Neutrinos are dark because they are transparent. They can’t be lit up because light will not bounce off them. This total transparency is not a property of any familiar objects. Any solid, dust, gas, or plasma will absorb some part of the wide range of the electromagnetic spectrum. Glass looks transparent to visible light, but it nevertheless absorbs infrared and ultraviolet light.</p>
<p>To a physicist, rays of light carry energy and information in physical form. Light rays are interconnected ripples, speeding undulations of electricity and magnetism. They need no medium though which to pass, and so travel unimpeded through the vacuum of space. Unbounded in their range, and travelling at the ultimate top speed, they convey to us messages about objects at immense distances and times long past.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><strong>Introduction </strong></p>
<p>In a fascinating exposition about one of the clearest examples of duality in nature, Alan Barr talks about light and darkness in physics. Currently, models in physics frame light itself as a manifestation of symmetry - takes the form of electromagnetic waves, but where do these electromagnetic waves come from in the context of symmetry ? From first principles, it is clear that objects in nature need to obey natural symmetries like translation and rotation. </p>

<h3><strong>Denis Noble —Professor of Biology</strong></h3>
<p><em>Abstract</em> - 100 to 200 words  </p>
<p>Alan Barr talks about light and darkness in the context of physics. He talks about neutrinos and their lack of interaction with light. The chapter also discusses dark matter, which is another thing that doesn’t interact with light. There are some theories which relate these two ideas with symmetry - the photino might be the heaviour cousin of the photo, and gets its mass from symmetry breaking. He mentions the LHC for experiments.  </p>

<p>However, Noble argues that there are cases when randomness is used with purpose rather than just passively. In evolutionary biology, <strong>function</strong> is why some object or process occurred in a system that evolved through natural selection. In physiology, function is a purpose. In [1], Noble references studies that organisms use randomness to generate responses to high environmental stress. I like to think of this as an ‘explore’ mode instead of an ‘exploit mode’ in the aforementioned n-armed bandit problem. It’s kind of like a hail-Mary — when an organism encounters a challenge; it relies on randomness more and more to try and find something that works.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>In a previous post, I talked about order and disorder in physics. I gave examples of order emerging from disorder and vice-versa. The theme of order and disorder, randomness and structure, is a topic I have discussed quite a bit with Benedict Rattigan. In line with this theme and the upcoming exhibition on symmetry at the British Museum, I wanted to write an exposition on Denis Noble’s ideas on how order and disorder interact in biology.</p>
