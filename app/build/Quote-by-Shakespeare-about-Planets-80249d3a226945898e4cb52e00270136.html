<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>This book is a collection of essays that ... (insert big picture here) </p>
<p>The study of order and disorder appears in a vast range of academic fields. In physics, the word <strong>order</strong> is usually associated with a ‘state of low entropy’ - a state that has relatively few ways that it coud end up. In aesthetics, the order in philosophy might relate to strucure or proportion. In biology, order might refer to the organised structures in living organisms, like DNA. If we consider the word order in a more relaxed light, we might say that the definition of order might include symmetry. Symmetry, whilst subtley different from the word order, also plays a significant role in these fields. Again the role of symmetry is ubiquituous  in physics, symmetries lead to conserved quantities like energy and momentum. In aesthetics, symmetry forms an essential part of beauty,. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>On the flip side, the word disorder suggests a state of randomness. Whilst I will fully define what chaos and order mean in the next paragraphs, we are still able to speak about them informally. However, both words elude to the study of complex systems. The word chaos suggests a level of unpredictability. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>An online open-access journal was launched at Oxford University in April 2022. ‘<em>Bi-Symmetrics: The Journal of Symmetry &amp; Asymmetry’</em> is edited by Denis Noble and Benedict Rattigan, and it explores the correspondence of opposites in fields as diverse as genetics, physics, mathematics and philosophy.</p>
<h3>The interplay between the two</h3>
<p>Order and disorder at first glance, are disparate fields. These two subjects are often treated separately - whilst there is a wealth of literature on these concepts, we think that there is not much that binds the concepts of order and disorder together. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>However, there is evidence to suggest an underlying correspondence, or mechanism, between symmetry and asymmetry itself. This correspondence is akin to a <em>symmetry of symmetry and asymmetry</em>, rather. The idea of co-dependence between symmetry and asymmetry is by far from new. In line with ancient symbolism in the past, it seems that there is co-dependence between the two that eludes to natures ordering principle. We think there is. There are some explicit examples of this in physics. Symmetry breaking occurs at the transition of when a physical system with a symmetric Lagrangian enters a ground state that is no longer symmetric. </p>
<p>This book is a collection of articles that highlight the role of symmetry, order, and chaos in different academic fields. Throughout, we will also be expanding on the crucial ideas that invovle the interplay between order and disorder. The precise definition of ‘interplay’ is something that will be made clear, as we review examples from a range of academic fields. We will explore the definitions of order and disorder, and then look at examples of their interdependence.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>What do exactly do we mean by the interplay between order and disorder? How does order arise from disorder? Is disorder a necessary ingredient to achieve an ordered state?  It will examine the profound, although somewhat initially paradoxical ‘symmetry of symmetry and asymmetry’.  </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The interplay between order and chaos has been a central theme of importance in ancient civilisations. Rattigan writes about how the  ancient Egyptians viewed order and chaos as participant in a vast cosmic battle. This was an ancient, ongoing battle between the goddess of order, Ma’at, and the goddess of Chaos Isfet. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>What exactly does symmetry mean?</h3>
<p>The study of symmetry in physics is incredibly well established. Symmetry, in the context of modern physics,  refers to transformations that leaves a system unchanged.  Symmetries that are smooth lead to conserved quantities.  </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The analysis of a physical theory starts with the Lagrangian, which is a system’s kinetic energy subtracted by its potential energy. The construction of a Lagrangian is usually motivated by symmetries, and their shape needs to reflect this in nature. The most apparent set of symmetries a physical theory needs to obey is the Poincaré group. The Poincaré group is, I would say, the most intuitive set of symmetry transformations in <a href="http://nature.IN">nature.</a> Symmetry groups that can be parametrised by smooth shapes also have a crucial role in physics. They are called Lie groups. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Dimitra Rigopolou, in her essay on symmetry on the universe, talks about symmetry and entropy. In particular Rigopolou talks about symmetries in the Standard Model of particle physics.  The Standard Model of particle physics gives rise to the fundamental particles we have currently observed. This model too has symmetries She mentions three that are of note - charge, parity and time reversal. On the flip side, she also describes entropy. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>What does Disorder mean?</h3>
<p>On the flip side, both physics and the social sciences have led a very successful inquiry into the study of chaos and disorder. The definitions of these terms are subtlety different, but for ease of reading the introduction I will put them in the same category. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Now, what do we mean exactly by 'chaotic' and 'disordered'? Whilst many philosophers are trying to dig into that question, there are a few principles that we can go by. Firstly, how <em>stable</em> is the system? By stable, we mean the sensitivity of a physical system's state to the <strong>initial conditions </strong>that it is placed. Physical systems are governed by a system of equations that we have to solve. But, for the most part, these equations only lead us to a 'general shape' of the solution unless we plug in some data about the initial conditions themselves.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>For example, imagine a pool table on the first hit. As physicists, we'd need to know the initial force and direction of the pool cue to predict the final state. We then ask ourselves if small changes in the initial conditions lead to significant changes in the final outcome. In the case of a pool game, the intuitive answer is yes — had we nudged the first player to miss her initial shot slightly, we could've ended up with a completely different game. In the same vein, if a physical system exhibits a high degree of sensitivity to its initial conditions, we might consider it a complex system.</p>

<p>Alan Barr - <strong>Professor of Particle Physics
</strong><em>Abstract</em> - 100 to 200 words  </p>
<p>Alan Barr talks about light and darkness in the context of physics. He talks about neutrinos and their lack of interaction with light. The chapter also discusses dark matter, which is another thing that doesn’t interact with light. There are some theories which relate these two ideas with symmetry - the photino might be the heaviour cousin of the photo, and gets its mass from symmetry breaking. He mentions the LHC for experiments.  </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>These neutrinos exhibit the third kind of darkness. They are dark not because there is no light to strike them, like the darkness of the night. Nor are they dark because they absorb all the light that falls on them, like soot. Neutrinos are dark because they are transparent. They can’t be lit up because light will not bounce off them. This total transparency is not a property of any familiar objects. Any solid, dust, gas, or plasma will absorb some part of the wide range of the electromagnetic spectrum. Glass looks transparent to visible light, but it nevertheless absorbs infrared and ultraviolet light.</p>
<p>To a physicist, rays of light carry energy and information in physical form. Light rays are interconnected ripples, speeding undulations of electricity and magnetism. They need no medium though which to pass, and so travel unimpeded through the vacuum of space. Unbounded in their range, and travelling at the ultimate top speed, they convey to us messages about objects at immense distances and times long past.</p>

<h3><strong>Denis Noble —Professor of Biology</strong></h3>
<p><em>Abstract</em> - 100 to 200 words  </p>
<p>Alan Barr talks about light and darkness in the context of physics. He talks about neutrinos and their lack of interaction with light. The chapter also discusses dark matter, which is another thing that doesn’t interact with light. There are some theories which relate these two ideas with symmetry - the photino might be the heaviour cousin of the photo, and gets its mass from symmetry breaking. He mentions the LHC for experiments.  </p>

<p>However, Noble argues that there are cases when randomness is used with purpose rather than just passively. In evolutionary biology, <strong>function</strong> is why some object or process occurred in a system that evolved through natural selection. In physiology, function is a purpose. In [1], Noble references studies that organisms use randomness to generate responses to high environmental stress. I like to think of this as an ‘explore’ mode instead of an ‘exploit mode’ in the aforementioned n-armed bandit problem. It’s kind of like a hail-Mary — when an organism encounters a challenge; it relies on randomness more and more to try and find something that works.</p>
<p>In a previous post, I talked about order and disorder in physics. I gave examples of order emerging from disorder and vice-versa. The theme of order and disorder, randomness and structure, is a topic I have discussed quite a bit with Benedict Rattigan. In line with this theme and the upcoming exhibition on symmetry at the British Museum, I wanted to write an exposition on Denis Noble’s ideas on how order and disorder interact in biology.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>In biology, systems have been developed to defend against randomness. For example, neurons need to figure out how to reduce signal noise when transmitting electrical impulses so that our brains don’t get confused. However, in other amazing scenarios, there is evidence that organisms harness randomness to generate new functions to better survive against a change in their environment.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>This utilisation of randomness reminds me of optimising the ‘learning rate’ parameter in reinforcement learning. For example, consider the simple bandit problem where we have to infer the distribution of money in selecting n slot machines (where we want to choose the optimal slot machine to play). We might wish to have a high degree of randomness at the start to quickly scan the search space before honing on the most profitable machine.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Noble argues that this could be a resolution to free will - that human choices can stem from the stochasticity in the nervous system.  </p>

<p><strong>Anant Parekh FRS—Professor of Physiology</strong>
<em>Abstract</em> - 100 to 200 words  </p>
<p>Anant Parekh discusses calcium in ion channels. <strong>Ion channels </strong>are pore-forming <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membrane_protein">membrane proteins</a> that allow <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ions">ions</a> to pass through the channel pore. This process is probabilistic - the channels only have 10% chance of opening in response to stimuli. So nature needs to come up with methods that harness this probabilistic nature. This is another example of how living organisms harness stochasticity. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>It turns out that Ca2+ channels have private conversations with the transduction pathway, accomplished through a physical interaction between the channel and the transcription factor that relays information from the channel to the cell nucleus, where most of the genetic material is housed. Typically, a triumvirate of additional proteins is required to ensure these restricted communications take place with functional impact on the cell: a scaffolding protein that binds to the channel, the transcription factor itself and a protein that ensures the factor is activated only when the appropriate stimulus is received.</p>

<p><strong>Sir Anthony Kenny—Department of Philosophy
</strong>
Sir Anthony Kenny talks about his agreements and disagreements with Denis Noble. In particular, he refutes the free-will argument. He agrees about the role of stochasticity that is harnessed by biological organisms. However, he disagrees about Noble’s claims on free will. </p>
