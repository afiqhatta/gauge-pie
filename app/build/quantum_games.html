<h1>Quantum Games: A brief historical overview and primer</h1>
<p> In December 2018, I gave a brief talk at the Department of Physics, Universiti Malaya in Kuala Lumpur. This talk was on short introduction to the history and mechanics. A game is simply a mapping from a space of strategies by two or more players, to a space of payoffs. A simple example of a game would be a each player tossing a fair coin, with each combination corresponding to some payoff to either player. 

This is an example of a classical game, where each player chooses their move unambigiously. In a quantum game however, we have participants prepare quantum states and apply operators to them as moves. This changes the dynamics of games greatly!
