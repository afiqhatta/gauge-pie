<h3> Some results on symplectic vector spaces</h3> 
<p> 
Much like the idea of orthogonal 
subspaces in regular linear algebra, 
we can also talk about the idea of 
symplectic orthogonal spaces on a symplectic manifold. 
A symplectic orthogonal of some linear subspace 
\( Y \)

\[\{  Y ^ \Omega = \{ v \in V \mid \Omega ( v, u ) = 0 , \forall u \in Y \} \] 

Firstly, we can show that \( \text{dim} Y + \text{dim} Y ^ \Omega  = \text{dim} V \). 
To do this, we can consider 
the map \( V \to Y ^ * = \text{Hom} ( Y , \mathbb{ R } ) \), 
where we send 
\[ v \mapsto \Omega ( v, \cdot ) \mid _ { Y } \]
The image of this map is \( Y ^ * \), and the kernel 
is by definition \( Y ^ \Omega\). Since \( \text{dim}  Y ^ * = \text{dim} Y \), 
the result follows by the rank-nullity theorem. 
</p>  

<p> 
An immediate result of this that 
we can bound the dimension of a subspace if it's 
isotropic. For example, if \( Omega \mid  { Y \times Y } = 0 \), 
then we know that \( Y \subset Y ^ \Omega \), so we can bound 

\[  2 \text{dim} Y \leq  \text{dim} V \] 
</p>

<p> 
If we have a vector subspace \( Y \) of codimension 1, 
then we have that \( \text{dim} ( Y ^ \Omega )  = 1\). 
So, we have that for any given \( u \in Y ^ \Omega\), 
we get that \( \Omega( u , v)  =\lambda \Omega ( u, u )  = 0 \), 
so 
\[ Y \subset ( Y ^ \Omega ) ^ \Omega)  = Y \]  


<h3>What is a symplectic manifold?</h3> 
<p> 
A de-Rham 2-form on a manifold \(M\) is a a map 
defined at every point on the manifold,
which takes product of the tangent space and sends it 
to the real numbers in a skew-symmetric fashion. 
In other words, it is a map \( \omega \) which is defined 
at every point \( p \in M \) such that 
the induced map 
\[ \omega_ p : T _ p M \times T_ \p M \to \mathbb{ R } \] 
is skew-symmetric. 
</p> 

<p> 
We say that \( \omega\) is closed if the exterior derivative is zero. 
Hence, the simplest example of a symplectic form is the following. 
If we let \( M \) be \( \mathbb{ R } ^ { 2 n } \), with coordinates 
\( x_ 1 , \dots x_ n , y _ 1, \dots y _ n \), then the form 
\[ \omega_ 0 = \sum _ { i =1} ^ n dx _ i \wedge d y _ i \] 
is a symplectic form, where the symplectic basis 
is just the set of vectors induced by those coordinates 
(the set of partial derivatives induced by those coordinates).
It is easy to show that the above is closed with the 
use of the identity 
\[ d ( a \wedge b ) = da  \wedge b + ( - 1 ) ^ a \wedge db \] 
  
</p>  
<p> 
Darboux's theorem is that locally, any symplectic manifold 
of dimension \( 2 n \) is symplectic to \( \mathbb[ R } ^ { 2 n } \), 
with the symplectic form defined above.  
<h3> Motivation and Moment maps </h3> 
<p> 
In terms of symplectic geometry, a momentum 
map is a map which helps us to construct conserved 
quantities. For example, the most famillar case 
we know is \( \mathbb{ R } ^ 3 \). 
If we set \( M \) to be our cotangent bundle of \( \mathbb { R } ^ 3 \),
which represents velocities and positiosn,  
and set our symmetries \( G \) to be translations and rotations, then 
the moment map has 6 components which are 3 angular momenta and 3 linear momenta. 
</p> 

<p> 
Formally, suppose we have a 
Lie group \( G \) which acts on a manifold \( M \). 
This Lie group is going to have an associated lie algebra \( L ( G  ) \). 
For some vector in the Lie algebra, call it \( X \), we have 
an induced vector field which acts on \( M \), given by 
\( \rho ( X ) \). 
</p>
<p> 
If we let \( \iota _ { \rho ( X ) } \) denote the contraction 
of this vector field with \( \omega\), 
then this map has a zero exterior derivative. 
</p> 

<p> 
Suppose that the map \( \iota _ { \rho ( X)  } \omega \) is not 
just closed, but also exact, so that 

\[ \iota _ { \rho ( X) } \omega  =d H _ {X } \]

Also, suppose that the map \( X \to H _ { X } \), 
is a Lie algebra homomorphism. Then a momentum map 
is a map \( \mu : M \to L ( G ) ^ * \), such that 

\[ d ( \langle \mu, X \rangle ) = \iota _ { \rho( X ) } \omega \] 
for all \( X  \in L ( G) \). To sense check above, 
we note that \( \rangle \mu, X \langle \) is a function defined 
on the manifold, so the exterior derivative of this object is 
a one-form. Equally, we have that \( \omega \) is a two-form 
so the contraction is also a one form. 
 
</p>   

<h3>Symplectic forms on cotangent bundles</h3> 
<p> 
There are some canonical structures we 
can make for cotangent spaces. Recall, 
a cotangent space \( T_ x ^ *  X\) at 
some point \( x \) in our manifold is the 
set of linear maps from the tangent space at that 
point to the reals. 
</p> 

<p> 
Since \( M \) is a manifold, 
we can describe it with a set of coordinate charts 
\( (U , x _ 1 , \dots , x_ n \), and at any point, we 
have some basis 
of differentials which form the basis of the cotangent space. 
This basis is the set of differentials 
\( (dx_1 ) _ x , \dots , (dx_ n)_x \). 
</p>

<p> 
For the cotangent bundle, since we 
parametrise the space by a covector, 
as well as a point on the manifold,
we can write a coordinate chart 
and treat the cotangent bundle as 
a \( 2n \) dimensional manifold. 
</p> 

<p>
We can define a symplectic form 
on the cotangent bundle, but we have to 
be very careful that this definition is coordinate 
independent. 
Since we have a manifold which looks like 
\[ \mathbb{ R } ^  { 2n } \], the first thing we can 
try is take the product 

\[ \omega = \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ n dx _ i \wedge d \xi _ i \]
</p>

<p> 
A coordinate free way to do define the 
symplectic 2-form is to construct what is called the 
tautological 1-form. In physics, the tautological 1-form is a 1-form 
used to associate velocity with momentum. Apparently, it is a way 
to link Hamiltonian mechanics with Lagrangian mechanics but it is not 
clear to me why yet. 
</p>

<p> 
Just like how we can define a push and pullback of 
between manifolds \(M , N \), we can also define 
pull and pushbacks between the manifold itself, as 
well as its cotangent bundle.
</p>

<p>
\( T ^ * Q \) is a covector field on the manifold \( M \). 
This means, at any point \( q \in Q\), there are a local 
set of coordinates \( q _ i \), which induce a basis 
of the tangent space given by the differentials \( \{ d q _ i \). 
Since we can write out a covector in terms of this basis, we 
can parametrise points \( (q, p ) \in T ^ * Q \) as \( p _ i d q ^ i \). 
</p> 

 
<p> 
If we let 
our manifolds be \( M = Q, N = T ^ * Q \), then 
the first thing we can do is to define a 
projection map between the two. 

\[ \pi : T ^ * Q \to Q \]
</p> 

<p> 
The whole point of this is that one 
can show that if we have a coverctor field, the pullback 
of this map is interpreted as a one form in its own right. 
</p>
<p> 
The pushforward of a given vector field 
\( X \) on the manifold \( T ^ * Q \) by the projection 
\( \pi \) are just the q components of the field. 
Similarly, the pullback just places all dp components to zero. 
We have \( \pi_ * : T T ^ * Q \to T ^ * Q \). 
In other words, \( X \) is first a vector field on 
the tangent space of \( T ^ * Q \), and now its mapped to the tangent space of \( Q \). 
</p> 

<p> 
Specifically, if we have a covector field on the manifold 
\( Q \), we can build a vector field which 
maps from \( T ^ * Q \to T T ^ *  Q \). Since the 
map we want to pushforward is from \( T ^ * Q \) to \( Q \), 
we are taking a vector field defined on \( T ^ *  Q \) 
and redefining it to a vector field defined just on \( Q \). 
</p> 

<p> 
In other words, we have the following maps 
which we want to pushforward and pullback: 

\[ \begin{aligned} 
X & : T ^ * Q \to T T ^ * Q \\ 
\pi _* X & : Q \to T Q \\ 
\eta : Q \to T ^ * Q \\ 
\pi ^ * \eta : T ^ * Q \to T ^ * T ^ * Q \\
\end{aligned} 
\] 

<p> 
At an arbitrary point, our phase space, we can write the tautological 
one-form as 
\[
			
\]  
</p>

<h3> Cancelling a pullback </h3> 
<p> 
This special one form has a nice property that it 
cancels out pullbacks of covector fields. 
So, the tautological one form is the one form characterised by this property. 
</p> 

<h3> Lagrangian submanifolds</h3> 
<p> 
A map between manifolds is an immersion if 
the associated derivative of the function 
is an injective one between the two manifolds. 
For example, if we have a mapping which injects 
between \( \mathbb{ R } ^ 1 \to \mathbb{ R } ^ 2 \), such as the obvious 
inclusion map

\[ f :  x \mapsto (x, 0) \] 

then our derivative of this function is given by   
the matrix operation 

\[ Df_ 0  ( u ) = u \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\  0 \end{pmatrix} \] 
where in this case \( u \in \mathbb{ R }  =\mathbf T _ 0 \mathbb { R } \)
An embedding is a proper injective immersion, and so this 
classifies as an embedding. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
We wil now demonstrate that proper, injective immersions are 
the same as embeddings with a closed image. 
If we have an embedding \( f : X \to Y \) with a closed image in 
\( Y \). We need to show that this is proper, 
or that every preimage of a compact set is compact. 
The image \( Y \) is compact. 
</p> 

<p> 
What is the difference between an immersion and an embedding? 
</p> 

<p> 
Conversely, if we have a proper, injective immesrion, then it is an embedding. 
An embedding is an immersion which is a homeomorphsim onto its image. 
In topology, an embedding between two spaces \( X , Y \) is an injective, 
continuous map where the differential of the map 
is an injective map between tangent spaces.

<h3> Basic symplectic geometry</h3> 
<p> 
If we have a smooth manifold \( M \), then the 
two-form \( \omega \) is a symplectic form if 
the exterior derivative \( d \omega  = 0 \), and 
it is non degenerate. 
</p> 
<p> 
A degenerate bilinear form 
is a form such that we have a vector \( X \) 
in which \( \omega ( X , Y )  = 0 \forall Y \). In odd dimensions, 
skew symmetric matrices are always singular,  
so this requirement implies that our manifold \( M \) 
needs to have an even dimension.  
</p> 

<p> One of the simplest symplectic forms 
we can come up with is \( \mathbb{ R } ^2 \) 
paired with the bilinear form ... 
</p>  
<h3> A little more detail </h3> 
<p> 
We'll now define, a little more rigourously, 
what a moment map is. If we have a symplectic manifold given by 
\( M , \omega \), then the group 
of symplectomorphisms is the infinite dimensional 
Lie group which preserves 
the two form \( \omega \). So, we have that 

\[ Symp ( M , \omega)  = \{ \phi : M \to M \mid \phi ^ * \omega  = \omega \} \] 
This is a Lie group, so it also has an associated Lie algebra. 

<h3> Definitions </h3> 

<p>
A symplectic manifold is a manifold which has a skew-symmetric bilinear 
map attached to it,  
A Hamiltonian G-space parametrized by \( M , \omega, G, \mu \) 
where \( G \) is a compact Lie group, is the following. 


<h3> Examples </h3> 
<p> 
Let \( G = \mathbb{ R } ^ 3 \) be our Lie group, and 
let \( \mathbb{ R } ^ 6 \) be the underlying manifold. 
We can pair this manifold with the 
symplectic form \( \omega  = \sum d x_ i \wedge d y _ i \). 
Now, we have to have \( G \) act on the manifold in some way. We can
do this by having \( R ^ \3 ) act on the manifold by translations. 
Suppose that we have some element \( \mathbf{ a } \in \mathbb { R} ^ 3 \), 
then, we can map this to the group of symplectomorphisms 
by acting on the group via translations. 

\[\begin{aligned} 
 \mathbf { a } \in \mathbb{ R} ^ 3  & h\mapsto \psi _ \mathbf{ a} \in  \text{Symp} ( \mathbb{ R }^ 6, \omega ) \\
\psi _ \mathbf { a} ( \mathbf { x} , \mathbf{ y } )  &  = ( \mathbf { x } + \mathbf { a } , \mathbf { y } )  
\end{aligned} 
\] 
From this element in the Lie group, we can
